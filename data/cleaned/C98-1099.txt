Abstract 
In order to realize their full potential, multimodal systems 
need to support not just input from multiple modes, but 
also synchronized integration of modes. Johnston et al.(1997) model this integration using a unification opera
tion over typed feature structures. This is an effective so
lution for a broad class of systems, but limits multimodal 
utterances to combinations of a single spoken phrase with 
a single gesture. We show how the unification-based ap
proach can be scaled up to provide a full multimodal 
grammar formalism. In conjunction with a multidimen
sional chart parser, this approach supports integration of 
multiple elements distributed across the spatial, temporal, 
and acoustic dimensions of multimodal interaction. In
tegration strategies are stated in a high level unification
based rule formalism supporting rapid prototyping and it
erative development of multimodal systems. 
1 Introduction

Multimodal interfaces enable more natural and effi
cient interaction between humans and machines by 
providing multiple channels through which input or 
output may pass. Our concern here is with multi
modal input, such as interfaces which support simul
taneous input from speech and pen. Such interfaces 
have clear task performance and user preference ad
vantages over speech only interfaces, in particular 
for spatial tasks such as those involving maps (Ovi
att 1996). Our focus here is on the integration of in
put from multiple modes and the role this plays in the 
segmentation and parsing of natural human input. In 
the examples given here, the modes are speech and 
pen, but the architecture described is more general 
in that it can support more than two input modes and 
modes of other types such as 3D gestural input. 
Our multimodal interface technology is imple
mented in QuickSet (Cohen et al 1997), a work
ing system which supports dynamic interaction with 
maps and other complex visual displays. The initial 
applications of QuickSet are: setting up and inter
acting with distributed simulations (Courtemanche 
and Cercanowicz 1995), logistics planning, and nav
igation in virtual worlds. The system is distributed; 
consisting of a series of agents (Figure 1) which 
communicate through a shared blackboard (Cohen 
et al 1994). It runs on both desktop and handheld 
PCs, communicating over wired and wireless LANs. 
The user interacts with a map displayed on a wireless 
hand-held unit (Figure 2).

They can draw directly on the map and simultane
ously issue spoken commands. Different kinds of 
entities, lines, and areas may be created by drawing 
the appropriate spatial features and speaking their 
type; for example, drawing an area and saying 'flood 
zone'. Orders may also be specified; for example, 
by drawing a line and saying 'helicopter follow this 
route'. The speech signal is routed to an HMM
624 
based continuous speaker-independent recognizer. 
The electronic 'ink' is routed to a neural net-based 
gesture recognizer (Pittman 1991). Both generate 
N-best lists of potential recognition results with as
sociated probabilities. These results are assigned se
mantic interpretations by natural language process
ing and gesture interpretation agents respectively. 
A multimodal integrator agent fields input from the 
natural language and gesture interpretation agents 
;and selects tim appropriate multimodal or unimodal 
commands to execute. These are passed on to a 
bridge agent which provides an API to the underly
ing applications the system is used to control. 
In the approach to multimodal integration pro
posed by Johnston et al 1997, integration of spoken 
and gestural input is driven by a unification opera
tion over typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992) 
representing the semantic contributions of the differ
ent modes. This approach overcomes the limitations 
of previous approaches in that it allows for a full 
range of gestural input beyond simple deictic point
ing gestures. Unlike speech-driven systems (Bolt 
1980, Neal and Shapiro 1991, Koons et al 1993, 
Wauchope 1994), it is fully multimodal in that all el
ements of the content of a command can be in ei
ther mode. Furthennore, compared to related frame
merging strategies (Vo and Wood 1996), it provides 
a well understood, generally applicable common 
meaning representation for the different modes and 
a formally well defined mechanism for multimodal 
integration. However, while this approach provides 
an efficient solution for a broad class of multimodal 
systems, there are significant limitations on the ex
pressivity and generality of the approach. 
A wide range of potential multimodal utterances 
fall outside the expressive potential of the previous 
architecture. Empirical studies of multimodal in
teraction (Oviatt 1996), utilizing wizard-of-oz tech
niques, have shown that when users are free to inter
act with any combination of speech and pen, a single 
spoken utterance maybe associated with more than 
one gesture. For example, a number of deictic point
ing gestures may be associated with a single spo
ken utterance: 'calculate distance from here to here', 
"put that there', 'move this team to here and prepare 
to rescue residents from this building'. Speech may 
also be combined with a series of gestures of differ
ent types: the user circles a vehicle on the map, says 
"follow this route', and draws an arrow indicating 
the route to be followed. 
In addition to more complex multipart multi
modal utterances, unimodal gestural utterances may 
contain several component gestures which compose 
to yield a command. For example, to create an entity 
with a specific orientation, a user might draw the en
tity and then draw an arrow leading out from it (Fig
ure 3 (a)). To specify a movement, the user might 
draw an arrow indicating the extent of the move and 
indicate departure and arrival times by writing ex
pressions at the base and head (Figure 3 (b)). These 
Figure 3: Complex Unimodal Gestures 
are specific examples of the more general problem of 
visual parsing, which has been a focus of attention 
in research on visual programming and pembased 
interfaces for the creation of complex graphical ob
jects such as mathematical equations and flowcharts 
(Lakin 1986, Wittenburg et al 1991, Helm et al 1991, 
Crimi et al 1995). 
The approach of Johnston et al 1997 also faces 
fundamental architectural problems. The multi
modal integration strategy is hard-coded into the in
tegration agent and there is no isolatable statement 
of the rules and constraints independent of the code 
itself. As the range of multimodal utterances sup
ported is extended, it becomes essential that there 
be a declarative statement of the grammar of multi
modal utterances, separate from the algorithms and 
mechanisms of parsing. This will enable system de
velopers to describe integration strategies in a high 
level representation, facilitating rapid prototyping 
and iterative development of multimodal systems. 
2 Parsing
in Multidimensional Space 
The integrator in Johnston et al 1997 does in essence 
parse input, but the resulting structures can only be 
unary or binary trees one level deep; unimodal spo
ken or gestural commands and multimodal combina
tions consisting of a single spoken element and a sin
gle gesture. In order to account for a broader range 
of multimodal expressions, a more general parsing 
mechanism is needed. 
Chart parsing methods have proven effective for 
parsing strings and are commonplace in natural 
language processing (Kay 1980). Chart parsing 
involves population of a triangular matrix of 
well-formed constituents: chart(i, j), where i and 
j are numbered vertices delimiting the start and 
end of the string. In its most basic formulation, 
chart parsing can be defined as follows, where , 
is an operator which combines two constituents in 
accordance with the rules of the grammar. 
cha,'t(i,j) = U chart(i, k), chart(k,j) 
i<k<j 
Crucially, this requires the combining constituents 
to be discrete and linearly ordered. However, 
multimodal input does not meet these requirements: 
625 
gestural input spans two (or three) spatial dimen
sions, there is an additional non-spatial acoustic 
dimension of speech, and both gesture and speech 
are distributed across the temporal dimension. 
Unlike words in a string, speech and gesture may 
overlap temporally, and there is no single dimension 
on which the input is linear and discrete. So then, 
how can we parse in this multidimensional space of 
speech and gesture? What is the rule for chart pars
ing in multi-dimensional space? Our formulation of 
multidimensional parsing for multimodal systems 
(multiehart) is as follows. 
rnultichart(X) = U multichart(Y) , multichart(Z) 
whereX = YUZ, YNZ =O,Y #O,Z #O 
In place of numerical spans within a single 
dimension (e.g. chart(3,5)), edges in the mul
tidimensional chart are identified by sets (e.g. 
multiehart( {\[s, 4, 2\], \[g, 6, 1\]})) containing the 
identifiers(IDs) of the terminal input elements 
they contain. When two edges combine, the ID of 
the resulting edge is the union of their IDs. One 
constraint that linearity enforced, which we can still 
maintain, is that a given piece of input can only be 
used once within a single parse. This is captured by 
a requirement of non-intersection between the ID 
sets associated with edges being combined. This 
requirement is especially important since a single 
piece of spoken or gestural input may have multiple 
interpretations available in the chart. To prevent 
multiple interpretations of a single signal being 
used, they are assigned IDs which are identical with 
respect to the the non-intersection constraint. The 
multichart statement enumerates all the possible 
combinations that need to be considered given a set 
of inputs whose IDs are contained in a set X. 
The multidimensional parsing algorithm (Figure 
4) runs bottom-up from the input elements, build
ing progressively larger constituents in accordance 
with the ruleset. An agenda is used to store edges 
to be processed. As a simplifying assumption, rules 
are assumed to be binary. It is straightforward to ex
tend the approach to allow for non-binary rules using 
techniques from active chart parsing (Earley 1970), 
but this step is of limited value given the availability 
of multimodal subcategorization (Section 4).

Figure 4: Multichart Parsing Algorithm 
For use in a multimodal interface, the multidi
mensional parsing algorithm needs to be embedded 
into the integration agent in such a way that input 
can be processed incrementally. Each new input re
ceived is handled as follows. First, to avoid unnec
essary computation, stale edges are removed from 
the chart. A timeout feature indicates the shelf
life of an edge within the chart. Second, the in
terpretations of the new input are treated as termi
nal edges, placed on the agenda, and combined with 
edges in the chart in accordance with the algorithm 
above. Third, complete edges are identified and ex
ecuted. Unlike the typical case in string parsing, the 
goal is not to find a single parse covering the whole 
chart; the chart may contain several complete non
overlapping edges which can be executed. These 
are assigned to a category command as described 
in the next section. The complete edges are ranked 
with respect to probability. These probabilities are 
a function of the recognition probabilities of the el
ements which make up the command. The com
bination of probabilities is specified using declar
ative constraints, as described in the next section. 
The most probable complete edge is executed first, 
and all edges it intersects with are removed from the 
chart. The next most probable complete edge re
maining is then executed and the procedure contin
ues until there are no complete edges left in the chart. 
This means that selection of higher probability com
plete edges eliminates overlapping complete edges 
of lower probability from the list of edges to be ex
ecuted. Lastly, the new chart is stored. In ongoing 
work, we are exploring the introduction of other fac
tors to the selection process. For example, sets of 
disjoint complete edges which parse all of the termi
nal edges in the chart should likely be preferred over 
those that do not. 
Under certain circumstances, an edge can be used 
more than once. This capability supports multiple 
creation of entities. For example, the user can utter 
'multiple helicopters' point point point point in or
der to create a series of vehicles. This significantly 
speeds up the creation process and limits reliance 
on speech recognition. Multiple commands are per
sistent edges; they are not removed from the chart 
after they have participated in the formation of an 
executable command. They are assigned timeouts 
and are removed when their alloted time runs out. 
These 'self-destruct' timers are zeroed each time an
other entity is created, allowing creations to chain 
together. 
3 Unification-based Multimodal 
Grammar Representation 
Our grammar representation for multimodal expres
sions draws on unification-based approaches to syn
tax and semantics (Shieber 1986) such as Head
626 
driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (Pollard 
and Sag 1987,1994). Spoken phrases and pen ges
tures, which are the terminal elements of the mul
timodal parsing process, are referred to as lexical 
edges. They are assigned grammatical representa
tions in the form of typed feature structures by the 
natural language and gesture interpretation agents 
respectively. Fox example, the spoken phrase 'heli
copter' is assigned the representation in Figure 5. 
eat : unit_type 
\[ r.'rYl,~ : un,t 
content : object : | type : hehcopter 
\[ echelon : vehtcte 
location : \[ fs'rYPE : point \] 
modMity : speech 
time : interval(.., ..) 
prob : 0.85 
Figure 5: Spoken Input Edge 
The cat feature indicates the basic category of the 
element, while content specifies the semantic con
tent. In this case, it is a create~nit command in 
which the object to be created is a vehicle of type 
helicopter, and the location is required to be a point. 
The remaining features specify auxiliary informa
tion such as the modality, temporal interval, and 
probability associated with tim edge. A point ges
ture has the representation in Figure 6. 
\[ f~TYPE : point \] 
content : L eoord : latlong( ..... ) 
modality : gesture 
t|nle : interval(.., ..) 
prob : 0.69 
Figure 6: Point Gesture Edge 
Multimodal grammar rules are productions of the 
form LHS -~ DTR1 DTR2 where LHS, DTR1, 
and D7'R2 are feature structures of the form indi
cated above. Following HPSG, these are encoded 
as feature structure rule schemata. One advantage 
of this is that rule schemata can be hierarchically 
ordered, allowing for specific rules to inherit ba
sic constraints from general rule schemata. The ba
sic multimodal integration strategy of Johnston et al.1997 is now just one rule among many (Figure 7).

Figure 7: Basic Integration Rule Schema 
The Ihs,dtrl, and dtr2 features correspond to 
LHS, DTR1, and DTR2 in the rule above. The 
constraints feature indicates an ordered series of 
constraints which must be satisfied in order for the 
rule to apply. Structure-sharing in the rule represen
tation is used to impose constraints on the input fea
ture structures, to construct the LIIS category, and 
to instantiate the variables in the constraints. For ex
ample, in Figure 7, the basic constraint that tile lo
cation of a located command such as 'helicopter, 
needs to unify with the content of the gesture it com
bines with is captured by the structure-sharing tag 
\[5\]. This also instantiates the location of the result
ing edge, whose eontent is inherited through tag \[1 \]. 
The application of a talc involves unifying the 
two candidate edges fox' combination against dtrl 
and dtr2. Rules are indexed by their cat feature in 
order to avoid unnecessary unification. If the edges 
unify with dtrl and dtr2, then the constraints are 
checked. If they are satisfied then a new edge is cre
ated whose category is the value of lhs and whose 
ID set consists of the union of the ID sets assigned 
to the two input edges. 
Constraints require certain temporal and spatial 
relationships to hold between edges. Complex con
straints can be formed using the basic logical op
erators V , A, and =>. The temporal constraint in 
Figure 7, overh+p(\[7\], \[10\]) V follow(\[7\], \[10\], 4), 
states that the time of the speech \[7\] must either 
overlap with or start within foul' seconds of the time 
of the gesture \[10\]. This temporal constraint is 
based on empirical investigation of multimodal in
teraction (Oviatt et al 1997). Spatial constraints are 
used for combinations of gestural inputs. For ex
ample, dose_to(X, Y) requires two gestures to be 
a limited distance apart (See Figure 12 below) and 
contact(X, Y) determines whether the regions oc~ 
cupied by two objects are in contact. The remaining 
constraints in Figure 7 do not constrain the inputs per 
se, rather they are used to calculate the time, prob, 
and modality features for the resulting edge. For 
example, the constraint combine.prob(\[8\], \[11\], \[4\]) 
is used to combine the probabilities of two inputs 
and assign a joint probability to the resulting edge. 
In this case, the input probabilities are multiplied. 
Tim assign_modality(\[6\], \[9\], \[2\]) constraint deter
mines the modality of the resulting edge. Auxiliary 
features and constraints which are not directly rele
vant to the discussion will be omitted. 
The constraints are interpreted using a prolog 
recta-interpreter. This basic back-tracking con
straint satisfaction strategy is simplistic but adequate 
for current purposes. It could readily be substi
tuted with a more sophisticated constraint solving 
strategy allowing for more interaction among colt
straints, dcfault constraints, optimization among a 
series of constraints, and so on. Tim addition of 
functional constraints is common in tlPSG and other 
unification grammar formalisms (Wittenburg 1993).

4 Multimodal
Subcategorization 
Given that multimodal grammar rules are required to 
be binary, how can the wide variety of commands in 
which speech combines with more than one gestural 
element be accounted for? The solution to this prob
lem draws on the lexicalist treatment of complemen
tation in HPSG. HPSG utilizes a sophisticated the
ory of subcategorization to account for the different 
complementation patterns that verbs and other lexi
cal items require. Just as a verb subcategorizes for 
its complements, we can think of a lexical edge in 
the multimodal grammar as subcategorizing for the 
edges with which it needs to combine. For example, 
spoken inputs such as 'calculate distance from here 
to here' and 'sandbag wall from here to here' (Figure 
8) result in edges which subcategorize for two ges
tures. Their multimodal subcategorization is speci
fied in a list valued subcat feature, implemented us
ing a recursive first/rest feature structure (Shieber 
1986:27-32).

Figure 8: 'Sandbag wall from here to here' 
The cat feature is subcat_command, indicating 
that this is an edge with an unsaturated subcatcgo
rization list. The first/rest structure indicates the 
two gestures the edge needs to combine with and ter
minates with rest: end. The temporal constraints 
on expressions such as these are specific to the ex
pressions themselves and cannot be specified in the 
rule constraints. To support this, we allow for lexical 
edges to carry their own specific lexical constraints, 
which arc held in a constraints feature at each level 
in the subeat list. In this case, the first gesture is 
constrained to overlap with the speech or come up 
to four seconds before it and the second gesture is 
required to follow the first gesture. Lexical con
straints are inherited into the rule constraints in the 
combinatory schemata described below. Edges with 
subeat features are combined with other elements 
in the chart in accordance with general combinatory 
schemata. The first (Figure 9) applies to unsaturated 
edges which have more than one element on their 
subeat list. It unifies the first element of the sub
eat list with an element in the chart and builds a new 
edge of category subcat_command whose subcat list 
is the value of rest.

Figure 10: Subca Termination Schema 
This specification of combinatory information in 
the lexical edges constitutes a shift from rules to 
representations. The ruleset is simplified to a set 
of general schemata, and the lexical representa
tion is extended to express combinatorics. How
evel, there is still a need for rules beyond these 
general schemata in order to account for construc
tional meaning (Goldberg 1995) in multimodal in
put, specifically with respect to complex unimodal 
gestures. 
5 Visual
Parsing: Complex Gestures 
In addition to combinations of speech with more 
than one gesture, the architecture supports unimodal 
gestural commands consisting of several indepen
dently recognized gestural components. For exam
ple, lines may be created using what we term gestu
ral diacritics. If environmental noise or other fac
tors make speaking the type of a line infeasible, it 
may be specified by drawing a simple gestural mark 
or word over a line gesture. To create a barbed wire, 
the user can draw a line specifying its spatial extent 
and then draw an alpha to indicate its type. 
Figure 1 l: Complex Gesture for Barbed Wire 
This gestural construction is licensed by the rule 
schema in Figure 12. It states that a line gesture 
628 
(dtrl) and an alpha gesture (dtr2) can be combined, 
resulting in a command to create a barbed wire. The 
location information is inherited from the line ges
ture. There is nothing inherent about alpha that 
makes it mean 'barbed wire'. That meaning is em
bodied only in its construction with a line gesture, 
which is captured in the rule schema. The close_to 
constraint requires that the centroid of the alpha be 
in proximity to the line.

6 Conclusion

The multimodal language processing architecture 
presented here enables parsing and interpretation of 
natural human input distributed across two or three 
spatial dimensions, time, and the acoustic dimension 
of speech. Multimodal integration strategies are 
t;tated declaratively in a unification-based grammar 
formalism which is interpreted by an iucremental 
multidimensional parser. We have shown how this 
architecture supports multimodal (pen/voice) inter
faces to dynamic maps. It has been implemented and 
deployed as part of QuickSet (Cohen et al 1997) and 
operates in real time. A broad range of multimodal 
utterances are supported including combination of 
speech with multiple gestures and visual parsing of 
collections of gestures into complex unimodal com
mands. Combinatory information and constraints 
may be stated either in the lexical edges or in the rule 
schemata, allowing individual phenomena to be de
scribed in the way that best suits their nature. The ar
chitecture is sufficiently general to support other in
put modes and devices including 3D gestural input. 
The declarative statement of multimodal integration 
strategies enables rapid prototyping and iterative de
velopment of multimodal systems. 
The system has undergone a form of pro-active 
evaluation in that its design is informed by detailed 
predictive modeling of how users interact multi
modally, and incorporates the results of empirical 
studies of multimodal interaction (Oviatt 1996, Ovi
att et al 1997). It is currently undergoing extensive 
user testing and evaluation (McGee et al 1998). 
Previous work on grammars and parsing for mul
tidimensional languages has focused on two dimen
sional graphical expressions such as mathematical 
equations, flowcharts, and visual programming lan
guages. Lakin (1986) lays out many of the ini
tial issues in parsing for two=dimensional draw
ings and utilizes specialized parsers implemented in 
LISP to parse specific graphical languages. Helm 
et al (1991) employ a grammatical fi'alnework, con
strained set grammars, in which constituent struc
ture rules are augmented with spatial constraints. 
Visual language parsers me build by translation of 
these rules into a constraint logic piogralmafing lan
guage. Crimi et al (1991) utilize a similar relation 
grammar formalism in which a sentence consists 
of a multiset of objects and relations among them. 
Their rules are also augmented with constraints and 
parsing is provided by a prolog axiomatization. Wit
tenburg et al (1991) employ a unification-based 
grammar formalism augmented with functional con° 
straints (F-PATR, Wittenburg 1993), and a bottom
up, incremental, Earley-style (l:;arley 1970) tabular 
parsing algorithm. 
All of these approaches l'ace signilicant difticul
ties in terms of computational complexity. At worst, 
an exponential number of combinations of the in
put elements need to be considered, and the parse 
table may be of exponential size (Wittenburg et al.1991:365). Efficiency concerns drive Ildm et al.(1991:111) to adopt a committed choice strategy 
under which successfully applied productions can
not be backtracked over and complex negative and 
quantificational constraints arc used to limit rule ap
plication. Wittenburg et al's parsing mechanism is 
directed by expander relations in the grammar for
malism which filter out inappropriate combinations 
before they are considered. Wittenburg (1996) ad
dresses the complexity issue by adding top-down 
predictive infonnation to the parsing process. 
This work is fundamentally different froln all 
of these approaches in that it tbcuses on multb 
modal systems, and this has signilicant implications 
in terms of computational viability. The task dif
fers greatly from parsing of mathematical equations, 
flowcharts, and other complex graphical expressions 
in that the number of elements to be parsed is far 
smaller. Empirical investigation (Oviatt 1996, Ovi 
att et al 1997) has shown that multimodal utter
ances rarely contain more than two or three ele
ments. Each of those elements may have multi
pie interpretations, but the overall number of lexi
cal edges remains sufficiently small to enable fast 
processing of all the potential combinations. Also, 
the intersection constraint on combMng edges lim
its the impact of the multiple interpretations of each 
piece of input. The deployment of tiffs architecture 
in an implemented system supporting real time spo
ken and gestural interaction with a dynamic map 
provides evidence of its computational viability for 
real tasks. Our approach is similar to Wittenburg et 
629 
al 1991 in its use of a unification-based grammar for
malism augmented with functional constraints and 
a chart parser adapted for multidimensional spaces. 
Our approach differs in that, given the nature of the 
input, using spatial constraints and top-down predic
tive information to guide the parse is less of a con
cern, and as a result the parsing algorithm is signifi
cantly more straightforward and general. 
The evolution of multimodal systems is follow
ing a trajectory which has parallels in the history 
of syntactic parsing. Initial approaches to multi
modal integration were largely algorithmic in na
ture. The next stage is the formulation of declarative 
integration rules (phrase structure rules), then comes 
a shift from rules to representations (lexicalism, cat
egorial and unification-based grammars). The ap
proach outlined here is at representational stage, al
though rule schemata are still used for constructional 
meaning. The next phase, which syntax is under
going, is the compilation of rules and representa
tions back into fast, low-powered finite state devices 
(Roche and Schabes 1997). At this early stage in the 
development of multimodal systems, we need a high 
degree of flexibility. In the future, once it is clearer 
what needs to be accounted for, the next step will be 
to explore compilation of multimodal grammars into 
lower power devices. 
Our primary areas of future research include re
finement of the probability combination scheme for 
multimodal utterances, exploration of alternative 
constraint solving strategies, multiple inheritance 
for rule schemata, maintenance of multimodal di
alogue history, and experimentation with 3D input 
and other combinations of modes.
