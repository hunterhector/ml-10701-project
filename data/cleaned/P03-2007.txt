A Novel Approach to Semantic Indexing Based on Concept Bo-Yeong Kang Department of Computer Engineering Kyungpook National University 1370, Sangyukdong, Pukgu, Daegu, Korea(ROK) comeng99@hotmail.com Abstract This paper suggests the efficient indexing method based on a concept vector space that is capable of representing the semantic content of a document.
The two information measure, namely the information quantity and the information ratio, are defined to represent the degree of the semantic importance within a document.
The proposed method is expected to compensate the limitations of term frequency based methods by exploiting related lexical items.
Furthermore, with information ratio, this approach is independent of document length.
1 Introduction
To improve the unstable performance of a traditional keyword-based search, a Web document should include both an index and index weight that represent the semantic content of the document.
However, most of the previous works on indexing and the weighting function, which depend on statistical methods, have limitations in extracting exact indexes(Moens, 2000).
The objective of this paper is to propose a method that extracts indexes efficiently and weights them according to their semantic importance degree in a document using concept vector space model.
A document is regarded as a conglomerate concept that comprises by many concepts.
Hence, an ndimensional concept vector space model is defined in such a way that a document is recognized as a vector in n-dimensional concept space.
We used lexical chains for the extraction of concepts.
With concept vectors and text vectors, semantic indexes and their semantic importance degree are computed.
Furthermore, proposed indexing method had an advantage in being independent of document length because we regarded overall text information as a value 1 and represented each index weight by the semantic information ratio of overall text information.

Works Since index terms are not equally important regarding the content of the text, they have term weights as an indicator of importance.
Many weighting functions have been proposed and tested.
However, most weight functions depend on the statistical methods or on the document’s term distribution tendency.
Representative weighting functions include such factors as term frequency, inverse document frequency, the product of the term and inverse document frequency, and length normalization(Moens, 2000).
Term frequency is useful in a long document, but not in a short document.
In addition, term frequency cannot represent the exact term frequency because it does not include anaphoras, synonyms, and so on.
Inverse document frequency is inappropriate for a reference collection that changes frequently because the weight of an index term needs be recomputed.
A length normalization method is proposed because term frequency factors are numerous for long documents, and negligible for short ones, obscuring the real importance of terms.
As this approach also uses term frequency function, it has the same disadvantage as term frequency does.
Hence, we made an effort to use methods based on the linguistic phenomena to enhance the indexing performance.
Our approach focuses on proposing concept vector space for extracting and weighting indexes, and we intend to compensate limitations of the term frequency based methods by employing lexical chains.
Lexical chains are to link related lexical items in a document, and to represent the lexical cohesion structure of a document(Morris, 1991).
3 Semantic
Indexing Based on Concept Current approaches to index weighting for information retrieval are based on the statistic method.
We propose an approach that changes the basic index term weighting method by considering semantics and concepts of a document.
In this approach, the concepts of a document are understood, and the semantic indexes and their weights are derived from those concepts.
3.1 System
Overview We have developed a system that performs the index term weighting semantically based on concept vector space.
A schematic overview of the proposed system is as follows: A document is regarded as a complex concept that consists of various concepts; it is recognized as a vector in concept vector space.
Then, each concept was extracted by lexical chains(Morris, 1988 and 1991).
Extracted concepts and lexical items were scored at the time of constructing lexical chains.
Each scored chain was represented as a concept vector in concept vector space, and the overall text vector was made up of those concept vectors.
The semantic importance of concepts and words was normalized according to the overall text vector.
Indexes that include their semantic weight are then extracted.
The proposed system has four main components: † Lexical chains construction † Chains and nouns weighting † Term reweighting based on concept † Semantic index term extraction The former two components are based on concept extraction using lexical chains, and the latter two components are related with the index term extraction based on the concept vector space, which will be explained in the next section.
3.2 Lexical
Chains and Concept Vector Space Model Lexical chains are employed to link related lexical items in a document, and to represent the lexical cohesion structure in a document(Morris, 1991).
In accordance with the accepted view in linguistic works that lexical chains provide representation of discourse structures(Morris, 1988 and 1991), we assume that a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 a11 a12 a13 a11 a14 a13 a15 a8 a11 a16 a5 a4 a17 a18 a19 a4 a18 a20 a21 a22 a16 a21 a19 a20 a5 a4 a23 a24 a7 a10 a9 a25 a4 a26 a20 a21 a4 a27 a28 a11 a14 a29 a28 a30 a9 a14 a7 a13 a1 a16 a18 a4 a8 a14 a31 a7 a10 a27 a7 a8 a11 a16 a5 a4 a17 a18 a19 a4 a18 a20 a21 a10 a9 a32 a33 a34 a32 a13 a15 a10 a11 a14 a28 a14 a7 a13 a35 a36 a37 a37 a25 a23 a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 a11 a12 a13 a11 a14 a13 a15 a8 a11 a16 a5 a4 a17 a18 a19 a4 a18 a20 a21 a22 a16 a21 a19 a20 a5 a4 a23 a24 a7 a10 a9 a25 a4 a26 a20 a21 a4 a27 a28 a11 a14 a29 a28 a30 a9 a14 a7 a13 a1 a16 a18 a4 a8 a14 a31 a7 a10 a27 a7 a8 a11 a16 a5 a4 a17 a18 a19 a4 a18 a20 a21 a10 a9 a32 a33 a34 a32 a13 a15 a10 a11 a14 a28 a14 a7 a13 a35 a36 a37 a37 a25 a23 a38 a39 a40 a41 a42 a43 a38 a39 a40 a41 a42 a44 blood rate a38 a39 a40 a41 a42 a45 anesthetic machine device Dr.

Therefore, each concept was extracted by lexical chains.
For example, Figure 1 shows a sample text composed of five chains.
Since we can not deal all the concept of a document, we discriminate representative chains from lexical chains.
Representative chains are chains delegated to represent a representative concept of a document.
A concept of the sample text is mainly composed of representative chains, such as chain 1, chain 2, and chain 3.
Each chain represents each different representative concept: for example man, machine and anesthetic.
As seen in Figure 1, a document consists of various concepts.
These concepts represent the semantic content of a document, and their composition generates a complex composition.
Therefore we suggest the concept space model where a document is represented by a complex of concepts.
In the concept space model, lexical items are discriminated by the interpretation of concepts and words that constitute a document.
Definition 1 (Concept Vector Space Model) Concept space is an n-dimensional space composed of n-concept axes.
Each concept axis represents one concept, and has a magnitude of Ci.
In concept space, a document T is represented by the sum of n-dimensional concept vectors, ~Ci.
~T = nX i=1 ~Ci (1) Although each concept that constitutes the overall text is different, concept similarity may vary.
In this paper, however, we assume that concepts are mutually independent without consideration of their similarity.
Figure 2 shows the concept space version of the sample text.

Chains have four relations: synonym, hypernyms, hyponym, meronym.
The definitions on the score of each noun and chain are written as definition 2 and definition 3.
Definition 2 (Score of Noun) Let NRkNi denotes the number of relations that noun Ni has with relation k.
SRkNi represents the weight of relation k.
Then the score SNOUN(Ni) of a noun Ni in a lexical chain is defined as: SNOUN(Ni) = X k (NRkNi £SRkNi) (2) where k 2 set of relations.
Definition 3 (Score of Chain) The score SCHAIN(Chx) of a chain Chx is defined as: SCHAIN(Chx) = nX i=1 SNOUN(Ni)+penalty (3) where SNOUN(Ni) is the score of noun Ni, and N1;:::;Nn 2 Chx.
Representative chains are chains delegated to represent concepts.
If the number of the chains was m, chain Chx, should satisfy the criterion of the definition 4.
Definition 4 (Criterion of Representative Chain) The criterion of representative chain, is defined as: SCHAIN(Chx) ‚ fi¢ 1m mX i=1 SCHAIN(Chi) (4) 3.4 Information Quantity and Information Ratio We describe a method to normalize the semantic importance of each concept and lexical item on the concept vector space.
Figure 3 depicts the magnitude of the text vector derived from concept vectors C1 and C2.
When the magnitude of vector C1 is a and that of vector C2 is b, the overall text magnitude is pa2 +b2.
Text C1 w4+w5 = b w1+w2+w3 = a C2 ba 22 + ba ax 22 2 += ba by 22 2 += Figure 3: Vector space property Each concept is composed of words and its weight wi.
In composing the text concept vector, the part that vector C1 contributes to a text vector is x, and the part that vector C2 contributes is y.
By expanding the vector space property, the weight of lexical items and concepts was normalized as in definitions 5 and definition 6.
Definition 5 (Information Quantity, Ω) Information quantity is the semantic quantity of a text, concept or a word in the overall document information.
ΩT, ΩC, ΩW are defined as follows.
The magnitude of concept vector Ci is SCHAIN(Chi): ΩT = sX k C2k (5) ΩCi = C 2i qP k C2k (6) ΩWj = ΩT £ΨWjjT = Wj ¢CiqP k C2k (7) The text information quantity, denoted by ΩT, is the magnitude generated by the composition of all concepts.
ΩCi denotes the concept information quantity.
The concept information quantity was derived by the same method in which x and y were derived in Figure 3.
ΩWj represents the information quantity of a word.
ΨWjjT is illustrated below.
Definition 6 (Information Ratio, Ψ) Information ratio is the ratio of the information quantity of a comparative target to the information quantity of a text, concept or word.
ΨCjT, ΨWjC and ΨWjT are defined as follows: ΨWjjCi = SNOUN(Wj)S CHAIN(Ci) = jWjjjC ij (8) ΨCijT = ΩCiΩ T = C 2i P k C2k (9) ΨWjjT = ΨWjjCi £ΨCijT = Wj ¢CiP k C2k (10) The weight of a word and a chain was given when forming lexical chains by definitions 2 and 3.
ΨWjjCi denotes the information ratio of a word to the concept in which it is included.
ΨCijT is the information ratio of a concept to the text.
The information ratio of a word to the overall text is denoted by ΨWijT. The semantic index and weight are extracted according to the numerical value of information quantity and information ratio.
We extracted nouns satisfying definition 7 as semantic indexes.
Definition 7 (Semantic Index) The semantic index that represents the content of a document is defined as follows: ΩWj ‚ fl ¢ 1m mX i=1 (ΩWi) (11) Although in both cases information quantity is the same, the relative importance of each word in a document differs according to the document information quantity.
Therefore, we regard information ratio rather than information quantity as the semantic weight of indexes.
This approach has an advantage in that we need not consider document length when indexing because the overall text information has a value 1 and the weight of the index is provided by the semantic information ratio to overall text information value, 1, whether a text is long or not.
4 Experimental
Results In this section we discuss a series of experiments conducted on the proposed system.
The results achieved below allow us to claim that the lexical chains and concept vector space effectively provide us with the semantically important index terms.
The goal of the experiment is to validate the performance of the proposed system and to show the potential in search performance improvement.

Semantic Indexing Five texts of Reader’s Digest from Web were selected and six subjects participated in this study.
The texts were composed of average 11 lines in length(about five to seventeen lines long), each focused on a specific topic relevant to exercise, diet, holiday blues,yoga, and weight control.
Most texts are related to a general topic, exercise.
Each subject was presented with five short texts and asked to find index Table 1: Manually extracted index terms and relevancy to exercise Text Index Rel.
Text1 exercise(0.39) back(0.3) 0.64 pain(0.175) Text2 diet(0.56) exercise(0.31) 0.55 Text3 yoga(0.5) exercise(0.25) 0.45 mind(0.11) health(0.1) Text4 weight(0.46) control(0.18) 0.26 calorie(0.11) exercise(0.11) Text5 holiday(0.432) humor(0.23) 0.099 blues(0.15) Table 2: Percent Agreement(PA) to manually extracted index terms T1 T2 T3 T4 T5 Avg.
PA 0.79 1.0 0.88 0.79 0.83 0.858 terms and weight each with value from 0 to 1.
Other than that, relevancy to a general topic, exercise, was rated for each text.
The score that was rated by six subjects is normalized as an average.
The results of manually extracted index terms and their weights are given in Table 1.
The index term weight and the relevance score are obtained by averaging the individual scores rated by six subjects.
Although a specific topic of each text is different, most texts are related to the exercise topic.
The percent agreement to the selected index terms is shown in Table 2(Gale, 1992).
The average percent agreement is about 0.86.
This indicates the agreement among subjects to an index term is average 86 percent.
We compared these ideal result with standard term frequency(standard TF, S-TF) and the proposed semantic weight.
Table 3 and Figures 4-6 show the comparison results.
We omitted a few words in representing figures and tables, because standard TF method extracts all words as index terms.
From Table 3, subjects regarded exercise, back, and pain as index terms in Text 1, and the other words are recognized as relatively unimportant ones.
Even though exercise was mentioned only three times in Text 1, it had considerable semantic importance in the document; yet its standard TF weight did not represent this point at all, because the importance of exercise was the same as that of muscle, which is also mentioned three times in a text.
The proposed approach, however, was able to 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 exercise back pain leg muscle chest way routine program strength word w e i g h t a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a2 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a2 a10 a11 a12 a8 a5 a13 a4 a2 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a8 a11 a12 a14 a11 a3 a14 a8 a15 Figure 4: Weight comparison of Text1 Table 3: Weight comparison of Text 1 Text 1 Word Subject Weight Standard TF Semantic Weight exercise 0.39 0.29 0.3748 back 0.3 0.67 0.4060 pain 0.175 0.19 0.1065 chest 0.0 0.19 0.1398 leg 0.0 0.19 0.0506 muscle 0.0 0.29 0.0676 way 0.0 0.19 0.0 routine 0.0 0.19 0.0 program 0.0 0.09 0.0 strength 0.0 0.09 0.0 differentiate the semantic importance of words.
Figure 4 shows the comparison chart version of Table 3, which contains three weight lines.
As the weight line is closer to the subject weight line, it is expected to show better performance.
We find from the figure that the semantic weight line is analogous to the manually weighted value line than the the standard TF weight line is.
Figures 5 and 6 show two of four texts(Text2, Text3, Text4, Text5).
Figures on the other texts are omitted due to space consideration.
In Figure 5, pound is mentioned most frequently in a text, consequently, standard TF rates the weight of pound very high.
Nevertheless, subjects regarded it as unimportant word.
Our approach discriminated its importance and computed its weight lower than diet and exerciese.
From the results, we see the proposed system is more analogous to the user weight line than the standard TF weight line.

Table 4 lists the weight comparison to the index term exercise of five texts, and the subjects’ relevance rate to the general topic exercise.
Subjects’ relevance rate is closely related with the subjects’ weight to the index term, exericise.
The expected ranking result is as following Table 5.
TF weight method hardly discerns the subtle semantic importance of each texts, for example, Text1 and Text2 have the same rank.
Length normalization(LN) and standard TF discern each texts but fail to rank correctly.
However, the proposed indexing method provides better ranking results than the other TF based indexing methods.
4.3 Conclusion
In this paper, we intended to change the basic indexing methods by presenting a novel approach using a concept vector space model for extracting and weighting indexes.
Our experiment for semantic indexing supports the validity of the presented approach, which is capable of capturing the semantic importance of 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 diet pound exercise low-fat week husband weight player gym calorie word w e i g h t a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a2 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a2 a10 a11 a12 a8 a5 a13 a4 a2 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a8 a11 a12 a14 a11 a3 a14 a8 a15 Figure 5: Weight comparison of Text2 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 holiday humor blues season cartoon christmas negativity exercise sense word w e ig h t a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 a2 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a2 a10 a11 a12 a8 a5 a13 a4 a2 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a8 a11 a12 a14 a11 a3 a14 a8 a15 Figure 6: Weight comparison of Text5 Table 5: Expected ranking results to the query exercise Rank Rel.

Seen from the experimental results, the proposed method achieves a level of performance comparable to major weighting methods.
In an experiment, we didn’t compared our method with inverse document frequency(IDF) yet, because we will develop more sophisticated weighting method concerning IDF in future work.
