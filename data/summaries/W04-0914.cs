What is important to realize is that some NLP systems with SF capabilities are within reach in ONSE, using the already available resources, possibly with some modifications, primarily if not entirely on the static side, and that is not much different than changing domains for a “regular” NLP system (see Raskin et al.2002b). 7 Using Scripts of Complex Events for Deception Detection A main tool for DD, in particular TSF, is the expansion of the ontology by acquiring scripts of complex events, already found necessary for other higher-end NLP tasks (see Raskin et al.2003). There are strong connections among elements of many texts.
