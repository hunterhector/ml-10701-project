Abstract
This paper proposes a dependency parsing
method that uses bilingual constraints to
improve the accuracy of parsing bilingual
texts (bitexts). In our method, a target-
side tree fragment that corresponds to a
source-side tree fragment is identified via
word alignment and mapping rules that
are automatically learned. Then it is ver-
ified by checking the subtree list that is
collected from large scale automatically
parseddataonthetargetside. Ourmethod,
thus, requires gold standard trees only on
the source side of a bilingual corpus in
the training phase, unlike the joint parsing
model, which requires gold standard trees
on the both sides. Compared to the re-
ordering constraint model, which requires
the same training data as ours, our method
achievedhigheraccuracybecauseofricher
bilingual constraints. Experiments on the
translated portion of the Chinese Treebank
show that our system outperforms mono-
lingual parsers by 2.93 points for Chinese
and 1.64 points for English.
1 Introduction
Parsing bilingual texts (bitexts) is crucial for train-
ing machine translation systems that rely on syn-
tactic structures on either the source side or the
target side, or the both (Ding and Palmer, 2005;
Nakazawa et al., 2006). Bitexts could provide
more information, which is useful in parsing, than
a usual monolingual texts that can be called “bilin-
gual constraints”, and we expect to obtain more
accurate parsing results that can be effectively
used in the training of MT systems. With this mo-
tivation, there are several studies aiming at highly
accurate bitext parsing (Smith and Smith, 2004;
Burkett and Klein, 2008; Huang et al., 2009).
This paper proposes a dependency parsing
method, which uses the bilingual constraints that
we call bilingual subtree constraints and statistics
concerning the constraints estimated from large
unlabeled monolingual corpora. Basically, a (can-
didate) dependency subtree in a source-language
sentence is mapped to a subtree in the correspond-
ing target-language sentence by using word align-
ment and mapping rules that are automatically
learned. The target subtree is verified by check-
ing the subtree list that is collected from unla-
beled sentences in the target language parsed by
a usual monolingual parser. The result is used as
additional features for the source side dependency
parser. In this paper, our task is to improve the
source side parser with the help of the translations
on the target side.
Many researchers have investigated the use
of bilingual constraints for parsing (Burkett and
Klein, 2008; Zhao et al., 2009; Huang et al.,
2009). For example, Burkett and Klein (2008)
show that parsing with joint models on bitexts im-
proves performance on either or both sides. How-
ever, their methods require that the training data
have tree structures on both sides, which are hard
to obtain. Our method only requires dependency
annotation on the source side and is much sim-
pler and faster. Huang et al. (2009) proposes a
method, bilingual-constrained monolingual pars-
ing, in which a source-language parser is extended
to use the re-ordering of words between two sides’
sentences as additional information. The input of
their method is the source trees with their trans-
lation on the target side as ours, which is much
easier to obtain than trees on both sides. However,
their method does not use any tree structures on
21
the target side that might be useful for ambiguity
resolution. Our method achieves much greater im-
provement because it uses the richer subtree con-
straints.
Our approach takes the same input as Huang
et al. (2009) and exploits the subtree structure on
the target side to provide the bilingual constraints.
The subtrees are extracted from large-scale auto-
parsed monolingual data on the target side. The
main problem to be addressed is mapping words
on the source side to the target subtree because
there are many to many mappings and reordering
problems that often occur in translation (Koehn et
al., 2003). We use an automatic way for generat-
ing mapping rules to solve the problems. Based
on the mapping rules, we design a set of features
for parsing models. The basic idea is as follows: if
the words form a subtree on one side, their corre-
sponding words on the another side will also prob-
ably form a subtree.
Experiments on the translated portion of the
Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2002; Bies et al.,
2007) show that our system outperforms state-of-
the-artmonolingualparsersby2.93pointsforChi-
nese and 1.64 points for English. The results also
show that our system provides higher accuracies
than the parser of Huang et al. (2009).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 introduces the motivation of our idea.
Section 3 introduces the background of depen-
dency parsing. Section 4 proposes an approach
of constructing bilingual subtree constraints. Sec-
tion5explainsthe experimentalresults. Finally, in
Section 6 we draw conclusions and discuss future
work.
2 Motivation
In this section, we use an example to show the
idea of using the bilingual subtree constraints to
improve parsing performance.
Suppose that we have an input sentence pair as
shown in Figure 1, where the source sentence is in
English, the target is in Chinese, the dashed undi-
rected links are word alignment links, and the di-
rected links between words indicate that they have
a (candidate) dependency relation.
In the English side, it is difficult for a parser to
determine the head of word “with” because there
is a PP-attachment problem. However, in Chinese
it is unambiguous. Therefore, we can use the in-
formation on the Chinese side to help disambigua-
H e   a t e     t h e     m e a t w i t h      a     f o r k     .
( H e )+X( u s e )	��( f o r k )
3( e a t )6�( m e a t )�( . )
Figure 1: Example for disambiguation
tion.
There are two candidates “ate” and “meat” to be
the head of “with” as the dashed directed links in
Figure 1 show. By adding “fork”, we have two
possible dependency relations, “meat-with-fork”
and “ate-with-fork”, to be verified.
First, we check the possible relation of “meat”,
“with”, and “fork”. We obtain their corresponding
words “肉(meat)”, “用(use)”, and “叉子(fork)” in
Chinese via the word alignment links. We ver-
ify that the corresponding words form a subtree
by looking up a subtree list in Chinese (described
in Section 4.1). But we can not find a subtree for
them.
Next, we check the possible relation of “ate”,
“with”, and “fork”. We obtain their correspond-
ing words “吃(ate)”, “用(use)”, and “叉子(fork)”.
Then we verify that the words form a subtree by
looking up the subtree list. This time we can find
the subtree as shown in Figure 2.
+X( u s e )	��( f o r k )
3(eat)
Figure 2: Example for a searched subtree
Finally, the parser may assign “ate” to be the
head of “with” based on the verification results.
This simple example shows how to use the subtree
information on the target side.
3 Dependency
parsing
For dependency parsing, there are two main types
of parsing models (Nivre and McDonald, 2008;
Nivre and Kubler, 2006): transition-based (Nivre,
2003; Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003) and graph-
based (McDonald et al., 2005; Carreras, 2007).
Our approach can be applied to both parsing mod-
els.
In this paper, we employ the graph-based MST
parsing model proposed by McDonald and Pereira
22
(2006), which is an extension of the projec-
tive parsing algorithm of Eisner (1996). To use
richer second-order information, we also imple-
ment parent-child-grandchild features (Carreras,
2007) in the MST parsing algorithm.
3.1 Parsing
with monolingual features
Figure 3 shows an example of dependency pars-
ing. Inthegraph-basedparsingmodel,featuresare
represented for all the possible relations on single
edges(twowords)oradjacentedges(threewords).
The parsing algorithm chooses the tree with the
highest score in a bottom-up fashion.

Figure 3: Example of dependency tree
In our systems, the monolingual features in-
clude the firstand secondorder features pre-
sented in (McDonald et al., 2005; McDonald
andPereira, 2006)andtheparent-child-grandchild
features used in (Carreras, 2007). We call the
parser with the monolingual features monolingual
parser.
3.2 Parsing
with bilingual features
In this paper, we parse source sentences with the
help of their translations. A set of bilingual fea-
tures are designed for the parsing model.
3.2.1 Bilingual
subtree features
We design bilingual subtree features, as described
in Section 4, based on the constraints between the
sourcesubtreesandthetargetsubtreesthatarever-
ified by the subtree list on the target side. The
source subtrees are from the possible dependency
relations.
3.2.2 Bilingual
reordering feature
Huang et al. (2009) propose features based on
reordering between languages for a shift-reduce
parser. They define the features based on word-
alignment information to verify that the corre-
spondingwordsformacontiguousspanforresolv-
ing shift-reduce conflicts. We also implement sim-
ilar features in our system.
4 Bilingual
subtree constraints
In this section, we propose an approach that uses
the bilingual subtree constraints to help parse
source sentences that have translations on the tar-
get side.
We use large-scale auto-parsed data to obtain
subtrees on the target side. Then we generate the
mapping rules to map the source subtrees onto the
extracted target subtrees. Finally, we design the
bilingual subtree features based on the mapping
rules for the parsing model. These features in-
dicate the information of the constraints between
bilingual subtrees, that are called bilingual subtree
constraints.
4.1 Subtree
extraction
Chen et al. (2009) propose a simple method to ex-
tract subtrees from large-scale monolingual data
and use them as features to improve monolingual
parsing. Following their method, we parse large
unannotated data with a monolingual parser and
obtain a set of subtrees (STt) in the target lan-
guage.
We encode the subtrees into string format that is
expressed asst = w : hid(−w : hid)+1, wherew
refers to a word in the subtree and hid refers to the
word ID of the word’s head (hid=0 means that this
wordistherootofasubtree). Here, wordIDrefers
to the ID (starting from 1) of a word in the subtree
(words are ordered based on the positions of the
original sentence). For example, “He” and “ate”
have a left dependency arc in the sentence shown
in Figure 3. The subtree is encoded as “He:2-
ate:0”. There is also a parent-child-grandchild re-
lation among “ate”, “with”, and “fork”. So the
subtree is encoded as “ate:0-with:1-fork:2”. If a
subtree contains two nodes, we call it a bigram-
subtree. If a subtree contains three nodes, we call
it a trigram-subtree.
From the dependency tree of Figure 3, we ob-
tain the subtrees, as shown in Figure 4 and Figure
5. Figure 4 shows the extracted bigram-subtrees
and Figure 5 shows the extracted trigram-subtrees.
After extraction, we obtain a set of subtrees. We
remove the subtrees occurring only once in the
data. Following Chen et al. (2009), we also group
the subtrees into different sets based on their fre-
quencies.
1+refers to matching the preceding element one or more
times and is the same as a regular expression in Perl.

4.2 Mapping
rules
To provide bilingual subtree constraints, we need
to find the characteristics of subtree mapping for
the two given languages. However, subtree map-
ping is not easy. There are two main problems:
MtoN (words) mapping and reordering, which of-
ten occur in translation. MtoN (words) map-
ping means that a source subtree with M words
is mapped onto a target subtree with N words. For
example, 2to3 means that a source bigram-subtree
is mapped onto a target trigram-subtree.
Due to the limitations of the parsing algo-
rithm (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Carreras,
2007), we only use bigramand trigram-subtrees
in our approach. We generate the mapping rules
for the 2to2, 2to3, 3to3, and 3to2 cases. For
trigram-subtrees, we only consider the parent-
child-grandchild type. As for the use of other
types of trigram-subtrees, we leave it for future
work.
We first show the MtoN and reordering prob-
lems by using an example in Chinese-English
translation. Then we propose a method to auto-
matically generate mapping rules.
4.2.1 Reordering
and MtoN mapping in
translation
Both Chinese and English are classified as SVO
languages because verbs precede objects in simple
sentences. However, Chinese has many character-
istics of such SOV languages as Japanese. The
typical cases are listed below:
1) Prepositional phrases modifying a verb pre-
cede the verb. Figure 6 shows an example. In En-
glish the prepositional phrase “at the ceremony”
follows the verb “said”, while its corresponding
prepositional phrase “在(NULL)仪式(ceremony)
上(at)” precedes the verb “说(say)” in Chinese.

Figure 6: Example for prepositional phrases mod-
ifying a verb
2) Relative clauses precede head noun. Fig-
ure 7 shows an example. In Chinese the relative
clause “今天(today)签字(signed)” precedes the
head noun “项目(project)”, while its correspond-
ing clause “signed today” follows the head noun
“projects” in English.

Figure 7: Example for relative clauses preceding
the head noun
3) Genitive constructions precede head noun.
For example, “汽车(car)轮子(wheel)” can be
translated as “the wheel of the car”.
4) Postposition in many constructions rather
than prepositions. For example, “桌子(table)
上(on)” can be translated as “on the table”.
24
We can find the MtoN mapping problem occur-
ring in the above cases. For example, in Figure 6,
trigram-subtree “在(NULL):3-上(at):1-说(say):0”
is mapped onto bigram-subtree “said:0-at:1”.
Since asking linguists to define the mapping
rules is very expensive, we propose a simple
method to easily obtain the mapping rules.
4.2.2 Bilingual
subtree mapping
To solve the mapping problems, we use a bilingual
corpus, which includes sentence pairs, to automat-
ically generate the mapping rules. First, the sen-
tence pairs are parsed by monolingual parsers on
both sides. Then we perform word alignment us-
ing a word-level aligner (Liang et al., 2006; DeN-
ero and Klein, 2007). Figure 8 shows an example
ofaprocessedsentencepairthathastreestructures
on both sides and word alignment links.

Figure 8: Example of auto-parsed bilingual sen-
tence pair
From these sentence pairs, we obtain subtree
pairs. First, we extract a subtree (sts) from a
source sentence. Then through word alignment
links, we obtain the corresponding words of the
words ofsts. Because of the MtoN problem, some
words lack of corresponding words in the target
sentence. Here, our approach requires that at least
two words of sts have corresponding words and
nounsand verbsneed corresponding words. If not,
it fails to find a subtree pair for sts. If the corre-
sponding words form a subtree (stt) in the target
sentence, sts and stt are a subtree pair. We also
keep the word alignment information in the tar-
get subtree. For example, we extract subtree “社
会(society):2-边缘(fringe):0” on the Chinese side
andgetitscorrespondingsubtree“fringes(W 2):0-
of:1-society(W 1):2” on the English side, where
W 1 means that the target word is aligned to the
first word of the source subtree, and W 2 means
that the target word is aligned to the second word
of the source subtree. That is, we have a sub-
tree pair: “社会(society):2-边缘(fringe):0” and
“fringe(W 2):0-of:1-society(W 1):2”.
The extracted subtree pairs indicate the trans-
lation characteristics between Chinese and En-
glish. For example, the pair “社会(society):2-
边缘(fringe):0” and “fringes:0-of:1-society:2”
is a case where “Genitive constructions pre-
cede/follow the head noun”.
4.2.3 Generalized
mapping rules
To increase the mapping coverage, we general-
ize the mapping rules from the extracted sub-
tree pairs by using the following procedure. The
rules are divided by “=>” into two parts: source
(left) and target (right). The source part is
from the source subtree and the target part is
from the target subtree. For the source part,
we replace nouns and verbs using their POS
tags (coarse grained tags). For the target part,
we use the word alignment information to rep-
resent the target words that have correspond-
ing source words. For example, we have the
subtree pair: “社会(society):2-边缘(fringe):0”
and “fringes(W 2):0-of:1-society(W 1):2”, where
“of” does not have a corresponding word, the POS
tag of “社会(society)” is N, and the POS tag of
“边缘(fringe)” is N. The source part of the rule
becomes “N:2-N:0” and the target part becomes
“W 2:0-of:1-W 1:2”.
Table 1 shows the top five mapping rules of
all four types ordered by their frequencies, where
W 1 means that the target word is aligned to the
first word of the source subtree, W 2 means that
the target word is aligned to the second word, and
W 3 means that the target word is aligned to the
third word. We remove the rules that occur less
than three times. Finally, we obtain 9,134 rules
for 2to2, 5,335 for 2to3, 7,450 for 3to3, and 1,244
for3to2fromourdata. Afterexperimentswithdif-
ferent threshold settings on the development data
sets, we use the top 20 rules for each type in our
experiments.
The generalized mapping rules might generate
incorrect target subtrees. However, as described in
Section 4.3.1, the generated subtrees are verified
by looking up list STt before they are used in the
parsing models.
4.3 Bilingual
subtree features
Informally, if the words form a subtree on the
source side, then the corresponding words on the
target side will also probably form a subtree. For

Table 1: Top five mapping rules of 2to3 and 3to2
example, in Figure 8, words “他们(they)” and
“处于(be on)” form a subtree , which is mapped
onto the words “they” and “are” on the target side.
These two target words form a subtree. We now
develop this idea as bilingual subtree features.
In the parsing process, we build relations for
two or three words on the source side. The con-
ditions of generating bilingual subtree features are
that at least two of these source words must have
corresponding words on the target side and nouns
and verbs must have corresponding words.
At first, we have a possible dependency relation
(represented as a source subtree) of words to be
verified. Then we obtain the corresponding target
subtree based on the mapping rules. Finally, we
verify that the target subtree is included in STt. If
yes, we activate a positive feature to encourage the
dependency relation.

Figure 9: Example of features for parsing
We consider four types of features based on
2to2, 3to3, 3to2, and 2to3 mappings. In the 2to2,
3to3, and 3to2 cases, the target subtrees do not add
new words. We represent features in a direct way.
For the 2to3 case, we represent features using a
different strategy.
4.3.1 Features
for 2to2, 3to3, and 3to2
We design the features based on the mapping
rules of 2to2, 3to3, and 3to2. For example, we
design features for a 3to2 case from Figure 9.
The possible relation to be verified forms source
subtree “签字(signed)/VV:2-的(NULL)/DEC:3-
项目(project)/NN:0” in which “项目(project)”
is aligned to “projects” and “签字(signed)” is
aligned to “signed” as shown in Figure 9. The
procedure of generating the features is shown in
Figure 10. We explain Steps (1), (2), (3), and (4)
as follows:

Figure 10: Example of feature generation for 3to2
case
(1) Generate source part from the source
subtree. We obtain “V:2-的/DEC:3-N:0” from
“签字(signed)/VV:2-的(NULL)/DEC:3-项
目(project)/NN:0”.
(2) Obtain target parts based on the matched
mapping rules, whose source parts equal
“V:2-的/DEC:3-N:0”. The matched rules are
“V:2-的/DEC:3-N:0 =>W 3:0-W 1:1” and
“V:2-的/DEC:3-N:0 => W 3:2-W 1:0”. Thus,
we have two target parts “W 3:0-W 1:1” and
“W 3:2-W 1:0”.
(3) Generate possible subtrees by consider-
26
ing the dependency relation indicated in the
target parts. We generate a possible subtree
“projects:0-signed:1” from the target part “W 3:0-
W 1:1”, where “projects” is aligned to “项
目(project)(W 3)” and “signed” is aligned to “签
字(signed)(W 1)”. We also generate another pos-
sible subtree “projects:2-signed:0” from “W 3:2-
W 1:0”.
(4) Verify that at least one of the generated
possible subtrees is a target subtree, which is in-
cluded in STt. If yes, we activate this feature. In
the figure, “projects:0-signed:1” is a target subtree
in STt. So we activate the feature “3to2:YES”
to encourage dependency relations among “签
字(signed)”, “的(NULL)”, and “项目(project)”.
4.3.2 Features
for 2to3
In the 2to3 case, a new word is added on the target
side. The first two steps are identical as those in
the previous section. For example, a source part
“N:2-N:0” is generated from “汽车(car)/NN:2-轮
子(wheel)/NN:0”. Then we obtain target parts
such as “W 2:0-of/IN:1-W 1:2”, “W 2:0-in/IN:1-
W 1:2”, and so on, according to the matched map-
ping rules.
The third step is different. In the target parts,
there is an added word. We first check if the added
word is in the span of the corresponding words,
which can be obtained through word alignment
links. We can find that “of” is in the span “wheel
of the car”, which is the span of the corresponding
words of “汽车(car)/NN:2-轮子(wheel)/NN:0”.
Then we choose the target part “W 2:0-of/IN:1-
W 1:2” to generate a possible subtree. Finally,
we verify that the subtree is a target subtree in-
cluded in STt. If yes, we say feature “2to3:YES”
to encourage a dependency relation between “汽
车(car)” and “轮子(wheel)”.
4.4 Source
subtree features
Chen et al. (2009) shows that the source sub-
tree features (Fsrc−st) significantly improve per-
formance. The subtrees are obtained from the
auto-parsed data on the source side. Then they are
used to verify the possible dependency relations
among source words.
In our approach, we also use the same source
subtree features described in Chen et al. (2009).
So the possible dependency relations are verified
by the source and target subtrees. Combining two
types of features together provides strong discrim-
ination power. If both types of features are ac-
tive, building relations is very likely among source
words. Ifbothareinactive, thisisastrongnegative
signal for their relations.
5 Experiments
All the bilingual data were taken from the trans-
lated portion of the Chinese Treebank (CTB)
(Xue et al., 2002; Bies et al., 2007), articles
1-325 of CTB, which have English translations
with gold-standard parse trees. We used the tool
“Penn2Malt”2 to convert the data into dependency
structures. Following the study of Huang et al.(2009), we used the same split of this data: 1-270
for training, 301-325 for development, and 271-
300 for test. Note that some sentence pairs were
removed because they are not one-to-one aligned
at the sentence level (Burkett and Klein, 2008;
Huang et al., 2009). Word alignments were gen-
erated from the Berkeley Aligner (Liang et al.,
2006; DeNero and Klein, 2007) trained on a bilin-
gual corpus having approximately 0.8M sentence
pairs. We removed notoriously bad links in {a,
an, the}×{的(DE),了(LE)}followingtheworkof
Huang et al. (2009).
For Chinese unannotated data, we used the
XIN CMN portion of Chinese Gigaword Version
2.0 (LDC2009T14) (Huang, 2009), which has ap-
proximately 311 million words whose segmenta-
tion and POS tags are given. To avoid unfair com-
parison, we excluded the sentences of the CTB
datafromtheGigaworddata. Wediscardedthean-
notations because there are differences in annota-
tionpolicybetweenCTBandthiscorpus. Weused
the MMA system (Kruengkrai et al., 2009) trained
on the training data to perform word segmentation
and POS tagging and used the Baseline Parser to
parse all the sentences in the data. For English
unannotated data, we used the BLLIP corpus that
contains about 43 million words of WSJ text. The
POS tags were assigned by the MXPOST tagger
trained on training data. Then we used the Base-
line Parser to parse all the sentences in the data.
We reported the parser quality by the unlabeled
attachment score (UAS), i.e., the percentage of to-
kens (excluding all punctuation tokens) with cor-
rect HEADs.
5.1 Main
results
The results on the Chinese-source side are shown
in Table 2, where “Baseline” refers to the systems

with monolingual features, “Baseline2” refers to
adding the reordering features to the Baseline,
“FBI” refers to adding all the bilingual subtree
features to “Baseline2”, “Fsrc−st” refers to the
monolingual parsing systems with source subtree
features, “Order-1” refers to the first-order mod-
els, and “Order-2” refers to the second-order mod-
els. The results showed that the reordering fea-
tures yielded an improvement of 0.53 and 0.58
points (UAS) for the firstand second-order mod-
els respectively. Then we added four types of
bilingual constraint features one by one to “Base-
line2”. Note that the features based on 3to2 and
3to3 can not be applied to the first-order models,
because they only consider single dependencies
(bigram). That is, in the first model, FBI only in-
cludes the features based on 2to2 and 2to3. The
results showed that the systems performed better
and better. In total, we obtained an absolute im-
provement of 0.88 points (UAS) for the first-order
model and 1.36 points for the second-order model
by adding all the bilingual subtree features. Fi-
nally, the system with all the features (OURS) out-
performed the Baseline by an absolute improve-
ment of 3.12 points for the first-order model and
2.93 points for the second-order model. The im-
provements of the final systems (OURS) were sig-
nificant in McNemar’s Test (p < 10−4).

We also conducted experiments on the English-
source side. Table 3 shows the results, where ab-
breviations are the same as in Table 2. As in the
Chinese experiments, the parsers with bilingual
subtree features outperformed the Baselines. Fi-
nally, the systems (OURS) with all the features
outperformed the Baselines by 1.30 points for the
first-order model and 1.64 for the second-order
model. The improvements of the final systems
(OURS) were significant in McNemar’s Test (p <

Table 4 shows the performance of the system we

Huang et al. (2009). The results showed that our
system performed better than Huang2009. Com-
pared with the approach of Huang et al. (2009),
our approach used additional large-scale auto-
parsed data. We did not compare our system with
the joint model of Burkett and Klein (2008) be-
cause they reported the results on phrase struc-
tures.

6 Conclusion
We presented an approach using large automati-
cally parsed monolingual data to provide bilingual
subtreeconstraintstoimprovebitextsparsing. Our
approach remains the efficiency of monolingual
parsing and exploits the subtree structure on the
target side. The experimental results show that the
proposed approach is simple yet still provides sig-
nificant improvements over the baselines in pars-
ing accuracy. The results also show that our sys-
tems outperform the system of previous work on
the same data.
There are many ways in which this research
could be continued. First, we may attempt to ap-
ply the bilingual subtree constraints to transition-
28
based parsing models (Nivre, 2003; Yamada and
Matsumoto, 2003). Here, we may design new fea-
tures for the models. Second, we may apply the
proposed method for other language pairs such as
Japanese-English and Chinese-Japanese. Third,
larger unannotated data can be used to improve the
performance further.
