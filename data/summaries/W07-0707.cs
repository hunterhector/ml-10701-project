Whereas the use of linguistic knowledge for improving the performance of a statistical machine translation system is investigated in many publications for various language pairs (like for example (Nieen and Ney, 2000), (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005)), its use for the analysis of translation errors is still a rather unexplored area.

BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002) was devised to provide automatic evaluation of MT output.

An extended version of BLEU which uses n-grams weighted according to their frequency estimated from a monolingual corpus is proposed in (Babych and Hartley, 2004).

Let the length of the hypothesis sentence hypk be denoted as Nhypk, and the reference lengths of each sentence Nref k,r. Then, the total hypothesis length of the document is Nhyp =summationtextk Nhypk, and the total reference length is Nref = summationtextk N?ref k where N?ref k is defined as the length of the reference sentence with the lowest sentence-level error rate as shown to be optimal in (Leusch et al., 2005).

The BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002) and the closely related NIST metric (Doddington, 2002) along with WER and PER 48 have been widely used by many machine translation researchers.

It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al.2002). Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.

Although systems basedoninformationextraction(RadevandMcKeown 1998,Whiteetal.2001,McKeownetal.2002)anddiscourseanalysis(Marcu1999b,Strzalkowskietal.1999) alsoexist,wefocusourstudyonthepotentialandlimitationsofsentenceextractionsystemswiththehopethat ourresultswillfurtherprogressinmostoftheautomatic textsummarizationsystemsandevaluationsetup.

We present our experimental designs to address these questionsinthefollowingsections. 4.1 Performance Upper Bound Estimation UsingOracleExtract Inordertoestimatethepotentialofsentenceextraction systems,itisimportanttoknowtheupperboundthatan ideal sentence extraction method might achieve and howfarthestate-of-the-artsystemsareawayfromthe bound. If the upper bound is close to state-of-the-art systems performance then we need to look for other summarizationmethodstoimproveperformance.Ifthe upper bound is much higher than any current systems canachieve,thenitisreasonabletoinvestmoreeffortin sentence extraction methods. The question is how to estimatetheperformanceupperbound.Oursolutionis tocastthisestimationproblemasanoptimizationproblem. We exhaustively generate all possible sentence combinationsthatsatisfygivenlengthconstraintsfora summary, for example, all the sentence combinations totaling 1005 words. We then compute the unigram co-occurrence score for each sentence combination, against the ideal. The best combinations are the ones withthehighestunigramco-occurrencescore.Wecall this sentence combination the oracle extract. Figure 1 showsanoracleextractfordocumentAP900424-0035.
