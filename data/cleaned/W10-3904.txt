Abstract
Classifying and identifying semantic re-
lations between facts and opinions on
the Web is of utmost importance for or-
ganizing information on the Web, how-
ever, this requires consideration of a
broader set of semantic relations than are
typically handled in Recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment (RTE), Cross-document
Structure Theory (CST), and similar
tasks. In this paper, we describe the con-
struction and evaluation of a system that
identiﬁes and classiﬁes semantic rela-
tions in Internet data. Our system targets
a set of semantic relations that have been
inspired by CST but that have been gen-
eralized and broadened to facilitate ap-
plication to mixed fact and opinion data
from the Internet. Our system identi-
ﬁes these semantic relations in Japanese
Webtextsusingacombinationoflexical,
syntactic, and semantic information and
evaluate our system against gold stan-
dard data that was manually constructed
for this task. We will release all gold
standard data used in training and eval-
uation of our system this summer.
1 Introduction
The task of organizing the information on the In-
ternet to help users ﬁnd facts and opinions on
their topics of interest is increasingly important
as more people turn to the Web as a source of
important information. The vast amounts of re-
search conducted in NLP on automatic summa-
rization, opinion mining, and question answer-
ing are illustrative of the great interest in mak-
ing relevant information easier to ﬁnd. Provid-
ing Internet users with thorough information re-
quires recognizing semantic relations between
both facts and opinions, however the assump-
tions made by current approaches are often in-
compatible with this goal. For example, the
existing semantic relations considered in Rec-
ognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Dagan et
al., 2005) are often too narrow in scope to be
directly applicable to text on the Internet, and
theories like Cross-document Structure Theory
(CST) (Radev, 2000) are only applicable to facts
or second-hand reporting of opinions rather than
relations between both.
As part of the STATEMENT MAP project we
proposed the development of a system to sup-
port information credibility analysis on the Web
(Murakami et al., 2009b) by automatically sum-
marizing facts and opinions on topics of inter-
est to users and showing them the evidence and
conﬂicts for each viewpoint. To facilitate the de-
tection of semantic relations in Internet data, we
deﬁnedasentence-likeunitofinformationcalled
the statement that encompasses both facts and
opinions, started compiling a corpus of state-
ments annotated with semantic relations (Mu-
rakami et al., 2009a), and begin constructing a
system to automatically identify semantic rela-
tions between statements.
In this paper, we describe the construction and
evaluation of a prototype semantic relation iden-
tiﬁcation system. We build on the semantic rela-
tions proposed in RTE and CST and in our pre-
vious work, reﬁning them into a streamlined set
of semantic relations that apply across facts and
opinions, but that are simple enough to make
automatic recognition of semantic relations be-
tween statements in Internet text possible.Our
semantic relations are [AGREEMENT], [CON-
FLICT], [CONFINEMENT], and [EVIDENCE].
[AGREEMENT] and [CONFLICT] are expansions
ofthe [EQUIVALENCE] and [CONTRADICTION]
21
relations used in RTE. [CONFINEMENT] and
[EVIDENCE] are new relations between facts
and opinions that are essential for understanding
how statements on a topic are inter-related.
Our task differs from opinion mining and sen-
timent analysis which largely focus on identify-
ing the polarity of an opinion for deﬁned param-
eters rather than identify how facts and opinions
relate to each other, and it differs from web doc-
ument summarization tasks which focus on ex-
tractinginformationfromwebpagestructureand
contextual information from hyperlinks rather
than analyzing the semantics of the language on
the webpage itself.
We present a system that automatically iden-
tiﬁes semantic relations between statements in
Japanese Internet texts. Our system uses struc-
tural alignment to identify statement pairs that
are likely to be related, then classiﬁes seman-
tic relations using a combination of lexical, syn-
tactic, and semantic information. We evaluate
cross-statement semantic relation classiﬁcation
on sentence pairs that were taken from Japanese
Internet texts on several topics and manually an-
notated with a semantic relation where one is
present. In our evaluation, we look closely at the
impactthateachoftheresourceshasonsemantic
relation classiﬁcation quality.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we discuss related work in summa-
rization, semantic relation classiﬁcation, opinion
mining, and sentiment analysis, showing how
existing classiﬁcation schemes are insufﬁcient
for our task. In Section 3, we introduce a set of
cross-sentential semantic relations for use in the
opinionclassiﬁcationneededtosupportinforma-
tion credibility analysis on the Web. In Section
4, we present our cross-sentential semantic re-
lation recognition system, and discuss the algo-
rithms and resources that are employed. In Sec-
tion 5, we evaluate our system in a semantic rela-
tion classiﬁcation task. In Section 6, we discuss
our ﬁndings and conduct error analysis. Finally,
we conclude the paper in Section 7.

Work
2.1 Recognizing
Textual Entailment
Identifying logical relations between texts is the
focus of Recognizing Textual Entailment, the
task of deciding whether the meaning of one
text is entailed from another text. A major
task in the RTE Challenge (Recognizing Tex-
tual Entailment Challenge) is classifying the se-
mantic relation between a Text (T) and a Hy-
pothesis (H) into [ENTAILMENT], [CONTRA-
DICTION], or [UNKNOWN]. Over the last sev-
eral years, several corpora annotated with thou-
sands of (T,H) pairs have been constructed for
this task. In these corpora, each pair was tagged
indicating its related task (e.g. Information Ex-
traction, Question Answering, Information Re-
trieval or Summarization).
The RTE Challenge has successfully em-
ployed a variety of techniques in order to rec-
ognize instances of textual entailment, including
methods based on: measuring the degree of lex-
ical overlap between bag of words (Glickman
et al., 2005; Jijkoun and de Rijke, 2005), the
alignment of graphs created from syntactic or se-
mantic dependencies (Marsi and Krahmer, 2005;
MacCartney et al., 2006), statistical classiﬁers
which leverage a wide range of features (Hickl
etal.,2005),orreferencerulegeneration(Szpek-
tor et al., 2007). These approaches have shown
great promise in RTE for entailment pairs in the
corpus, but more robust models of recognizing
logical relations are still desirable.
The deﬁnition of contradiction in RTE is that
T contradicts H if it is very unlikely that both T
and H can be true at the same time. However, in
real documents on the Web, there are many pairs
of examples which are contradictory in part, or
where one statement conﬁnes the applicability of
another, as shown in the examples in Table 1.
2.2 Cross-document Structure Theory
Cross-document Structure Theory (CST), devel-
oped by Radev (2000), is another task of rec-
ognizing semantic relations between sentences.
CST is an expanded rhetorical structure analy-
sis based on Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST:
(William and Thompson, 1988)), and attempts
to describe the semantic relations that exist
between two or more sentences from differ-
ent source documents that are related to the
same topic, as well as those that come from
a single source document. A corpus of cross-
document sentences annotated with CST rela-
tions has also been constructed (The CSTBank
Corpus: (Radev et al., 2003)). CSTBank is
organized into clusters of topically-related ar-
ticles. There are 18 kinds of semantic rela-
tions in this corpus, not limited to [EQUIVA-
LENCE] or [CONTRADICTION], but also includ-
ing [JUDGEMENT], [ELABORATION], and [RE-

FINEMENT]. Etoh et al. (Etoh and Okumura,
2005) constructed a Japanese Cross-document
Relation Corpus, and they redeﬁned 14 kinds of
semantic relations in their corpus.
CST was designed for objective expressions
because its target data is newspaper articles re-
lated to the same topic. Facts, which can be ex-
tracted from newspaper articles, have been used
in conventional NLP research, such as Informa-
tion Extraction or Factoid Question Answering.
However, there are a lot of opinions on the Web,
and it is important to survey opinions in addition
to facts to give Internet users a comprehensive
view of the discussions on topics of interest.
2.3 Cross-document Summarization Based
on CST Relations between Sentences
Zhang and Radev (2004) attempted to classify
CST relations between sentence pairs extracted
fromtopicallyrelateddocuments. However, they
used a vector space model and tried multi-class
classiﬁcation. The results were not satisfactory.
This observation may indicate that the recog-
nition methods for each relation should be de-
veloped separately. Miyabe et al. (2008) at-
tempted to recognize relations that were deﬁned
in a Japanese cross-document relation corpus
(Etoh and Okumura, 2005). However, their tar-
get relations were limited to [EQUIVALENCE]
and [TRANSITION]; other relations were not tar-
geted. Recognizing [EVIDENCE] is indispens-
able for organizing information on the Internet.
We need to develop satisfactory methods of [EV-
IDENCE] recognition.
2.4 Opinion
Mining and Sentiment Analysis
Subjective statements, such as opinions, have
recently been the focus of much NLP re-
search including review analysis, opinion ex-
traction, opinion question answering, and senti-
ment analysis. In the corpus constructed in the
Multi-Perspective Question Answering (MPQA)
Project (Wiebe et al., 2005), individual expres-
sions are tagged that correspond to explicit men-
tions of private states, speech event, and expres-
sive subjective elements.
The goal of opinion mining to extract expres-
sions with polarity from texts, not to recognize
semanticrelationsbetweensentences. Sentiment
analysis also focus classifying subjective expres-
sions in texts into positive/negative classes. In
comparison, although we deal with sentiment in-
formation in text, our objective is to recognize
semantic relations between sentences. If a user’s
query requires positive/negative information, we
will also need to extract sentences including sen-
timent expression like in opinion mining, how-
ever, our semantic relation, [CONFINEMENT], is
more precise because it identiﬁes the condition
or scope of the polarity. Queries do not neces-
sarily include sentiment information; we also ac-
cept queries that are intended to be a statement
of fact. For example, for the query “Xylitol is
effective at preventing cavities.” in Table 1, we
extract a variety of sentences from the Web and
recognize semantic relations between the query
and many kinds of sentences.

3 Semantic
Relations between
Statements
In this section, we deﬁne the semantic relations
that we will classify in Japanese Internet texts as
well as their corresponding relations in RTE and
CST. Our goal is to deﬁne semantic relations that
are applicable over both fact and opinions, mak-
ing them more appropriate for handling Internet
texts. See Table 1 for real examples.
3.1 [AGREEMENT]
A bi-directional relation where statements have
equivalent semantic content on a shared topic.
Here we use topic in a narrow sense to mean that
the semantic contents of both statements are rel-
evant to each other.
The following is an example of [AGREE-
MENT] onthetopicofbio-ethanolenvironmental
impact.
(1) a. Bio-ethanol is good for the environment.
b. Bio-ethanol is a high-quality fuel, and it
has the power to deal with the environ-
ment problems that we are facing.
Once relevance has been established,
[AGREEMENT] can range from strict logi-
cal entailment or identical polarity of opinions.
Here is an example of two statements that
share a broad topic, but that are not classiﬁed as
[AGREEMENT] because preventing cavities and
tooth calciﬁcation are not intuitively relevant.
(2) a. Xylitol is effective at preventing cavities.
b. Xylitol advances tooth calciﬁcation.
3.2 [CONFLICT]
A bi-directional relation where statements have
negative or contradicting semantic content on a
shared topic. This can range from strict logical
contradiction to opposite polarity of opinions.
The next pair is a [CONFLICT] example.
(3) a. Bio-ethanol is good for our earth.
b. There is a fact that bio-ethanol further the
destruction of the environment.
3.3 [EVIDENCE]
A uni-directional relation where one statement
provides justiﬁcation or supporting evidence for
the other. Both statements can be either facts or
opinions. The following is a typical example:
(4) a. I believe that applying the technology of
cloning must be controlled by law.
b. There is a need to regulate cloning, be-
cause it can be open to abuse.
The statement containing the evidence con-
sists of two parts: one part has a [AGREEMENT]
or [CONFLICT] with the other statement, the
other part provides support or justiﬁcation for it.
3.4 [CONFINEMENT]
A uni-directional relation where one statement
provides more speciﬁc information about the
other or quantiﬁes the situations in which it ap-
plies. The pair below is an example, in which
one statement gives a condition under which the
other can be true.
(5) a. Steroids have side-effects.
b. There is almost no need to worry about
side-effects when steroids are used for lo-
cal treatment.
4 Recognizing
Semantic Relations
In order to organize the information on the
Internet, we need to identify the [AGREE-
MENT], [CONFLICT], [CONFINEMENT], and
[EVIDENCE] semantic relations. Because iden-
tiﬁcation of [AGREEMENT] and [CONFLICT] is
a problem of measuring semantic similarity be-
tween two statements, it can be cast as a sen-
tence alignment problem and solved using an
RTE framework. The two sentences do not need
to be from the same source.
However, the identiﬁcation of [CONFINE-
MENT] and [EVIDENCE] relations depend on
contextual information in the sentence. For ex-
ample, conditional statements or speciﬁc dis-
course markers like “because” act as important
cues for their identiﬁcation. Thus, to identify
these two relations across documents, we must
ﬁrst identify [AGREEMENT] or [CONFLICT] be-
tween sentences in different documents and then
determine if there is a [CONFINEMENT] or [EV-
IDENCE] relation in one of the documents.
Furthermore, the surrounding text often con-
tains contextual information that is important for
identifying these two relations. Proper handling
of surrounding context requires discourse analy-
sis and is an area of future work, but our basic
detection strategy is as follows:
1. Identifya [AGREEMENT] or [CONFLICT] re-
lation between the Query and Text
2. Search the Text sentence for cues that iden-
tify [CONFINEMENT] or [EVIDENCE]
24
3. Infer the applicability of the [CONFINE-
MENT] or [EVIDENCE] relations in the Text
to the Query
4.1 System
Overview
We have ﬁnished constructing a prototype sys-
tem that detects semantic relation between state-
ments. It has a three-stage architecture similar to
the RTE system of MacCartney et al. (2006):
1. Linguistic analysis
2. Structural alignment
3. Feature extraction for detecting [EVIDENCE]
and [CONFINEMENT]
4. Semantic relation classiﬁcation
However, we differ in the following respects.
First, our relation classiﬁcation is broader than
RTE’s simple distinction between [ENTAIL-
MENT], [CONTRADICTION], and [UNKNOWN];
in place of [ENTAILMENT] and [CONTRA-
DICTION, we use broader [AGREEMENT] and
[CONFLICT] relations. We also consider cover
gradations of applicability of statements with the
[CONFINEMENT] relation.
Second, we conduct structural alignment with
the goal of aligning semantic structures. We do
this by directly incorporating dependency align-
mentsandpredicate-argumentstructureinforma-
tion for both the user query and the Web text
into the alignment scoring process. This allows
us to effectively capture many long-distance
alignments that cannot be represented as lexical
alignments. This contrasts with MacCartney et
al. (2006), who uses dependency structures for
the Hypothesis to reduce the lexical alignment
search space but do not produce structural align-
ments and do not use the dependencies in detect-
ing entailment.
Finally, we apply several rich semantic re-
sourcesinalignmentandclassiﬁcation: extended
modality information that helps align and clas-
sify structures that are semantically similar but
divergent in tense or polarity; and lexical simi-
larity through ontologies like WordNet.
4.2 Linguistic
Analysis
In order to identify semantic relations between
the user query (Q) and the sentence extracted
from Web text (T), we ﬁrst conduct syntactic and
semanticlinguisticanalysistoprovideabasisfor
alignment and relation classiﬁcation.
For syntactic analysis, we use the Japanese
dependency parser CaboCha (Kudo and Mat-

Figure 1: An example of structural alignment
sumoto, 2002) and the predicate-argument struc-
ture analyzer ChaPAS (Watanabe et al., 2010).
CaboCha splits the Japanese text into phrase-like
chunks and represents syntactic dependencies
between the chunks as edges in a graph. Cha-
PAS identiﬁes predicate-argument structures in
the dependency graph produced by CaboCha.
We also conduct extended modality analysis
using the resources provided by Matsuyoshi et
al. (2010), focusing on tense, modality, and po-
larity, because such information provides impor-
tant clues for the recognition of semantic rela-
tions between statements.
4.3 Structural
Alignment
In this section, we describe our approach to
structural alignment. The structural alignment
process is shown in Figure 1. It consists of the
following two phases:
1. lexical alignment
2. structural alignment
We developed a heuristic-based algorithm to
align chunk based on lexical similarity infor-
mation. We incorporate the following informa-
tion into an alignment conﬁdence score that has
a range of 0.0-1.0 and align chunk whose scores
cross an empirically-determined threshold.
• surface level similarity: identical content
words or cosine similarity of chunk contents
• semantic similarity of predicate-argument
structures
predicates we check for matches in predi-
cate entailment databases (Hashimoto et
al., 2009; Matsuyoshi et al., 2008) consid-
ering the default case frames reported by
ChaPAS
arguments we check for synonym or hy-
pernym matches in the Japanese WordNet
(2008) or the Japanese hypernym collec-
tion of Sumida et al. (2008)

Figure 2: Determining the compatibility of se-
mantic structures
We compare the predicate-argument structure
of the query to that of the text and determine
if the argument structures are compatible. This
processisillustratedinFigure2wheretheT(ext)
“Agricultural chemicals are used in the ﬁeld.” is
aligned with the H(ypothesis) “Over the ﬁeld,
agricultural chemicals are sprayed.” Although
the verbs used and sprayed are not directly se-
mantically related, they are aligned because they
share the same argument structures. This lets up
align predicates for which we lack semantic re-
sources. We use the following information to de-
termine predicate-argument alignment:
• the number of aligned children
• the number of aligned case frame arguments
• the number of possible alignments in a win-
dow of n chunk
• predicates indicating existence or quantity.
E.g. many, few, to exist, etc.
• polarity of both parent and child chunks us-
ing the resources in (Higashiyama et al.,
2008; Kobayashi et al., 2005)
We treat structural alignment as a machine
learning problem and train a Support Vector Ma-
chine (SVM) model to decide if lexically aligned
chunks are semantically aligned.
We train on gold-standard labeled alignment
of 370 sentence pairs. This data set is described
in more detail in Section 5.1. As features for our
SVM model, we use the following information:
• thedistanceinedgesinthedependencygraph
between parent and child for both sentences
• the distance in chunks between parent and
child in both sentences
• binary features indicating whether each
chunk is a predicate or argument according
to ChaPAS
• the parts-of-speech of ﬁrst and last word in
each chunk
• when the chunk ends with a case marker, the
case of the chunk , otherwise none
• the lexical alignment score of each chunk
pair
4.4 Feature
Extraction for Detecting
Evidence and Conﬁnement
Once the structural alignment system has iden-
tiﬁed potential [AGREEMENT] or [CONFLICT]
relations, we need to extract contextual cues in
the Text as features for detecting [CONFINE-
MENT] and [EVIDENCE] relations. Conditional
statements, degree adverbs, and partial negation,
which play a role in limiting the scope or degree
of a query’s contents in the statement, can be im-
portant cues for detecting the these two semantic
relations. We currently use a set of heuristics to
extract a set of expressions to use as features for
classifying these relations using SVM models.
4.5 Relation
Classiﬁcation
Once the structural alignment is successfully
identiﬁed, the task of semantic relation classi-
ﬁcation is straightforward. We also solve this
problem with machine learning by training an
SVM classiﬁer. As features, we draw on a com-
bination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic infor-
mation including the syntactic alignments from
the previous section. The feature set is:
alignments We deﬁne two binary function,
ALIGNword(qi,tm) for the lexical align-
ment and ALIGNstruct((qi,qj),(tm,tk))
for the structural alignment to be true if and
only if the node qi,qj ∈ Q has been seman-
tically and structurally aligned to the node
tm,tk ∈ T. Q and T are the (Q)uery and the
(T)ext, respectively. We also use a separate
feature for a score representing the likelihood
of the alignment.
modality We have a feature that encodes all of
the possible polarities of a predicate node
from modality analysis, which indicates the
utterance type, and can be assertive, voli-
tional, wish, imperative, permissive, or in-
terrogative. Modalities that do not repre-
sentopinions(i.e. imperative, permissive and
interrogative) often indicate [OTHER] rela-
tions.
antonym We deﬁne a binary function
ANTONYM(qi,tm) that indicates if
the pair is identiﬁed as an antonym. This
information helps identify [CONFLICT].

negation To identify negations, we primar-
ily rely on a predicate’s Actuality value,
which represents epistemic modality and
existential negation. If a predicate pair
ALIGNword(qi,tm) has mismatching actu-
ality labels, the pair is likely a [OTHER].
contextual cues This set of features is used to
mark the presence of any contextual cues
that identify of [CONFINEMENT] or [EVI-
DENCE] relations in a chunk . For example,
“wp(because)” or “h�(due to)” are typ-
ical contextual cues for [EVIDENCE], and “
qV(when)” or “s�y(if)” are typical for
[CONFINEMENT].
5 Evaluation
5.1 Data
Preparation
In order to evaluate our semantic relation clas-
siﬁcation system on realistic Web data, we con-
structed a corpus of sentence pairs gathered from
a vast collection of webpages (2009a). Our basic
approach is as follows:
1. Retrieve documents related to a set number
of topics using the Tsubaki1 search engine
2. Extract real sentences that include major sub-
topic words which are detected based on
TF/IDF in the document set
3. Reduce noise in data by using heuristics to
eliminate advertisements and comment spam
4. Reduce the search space for identifying sen-
tence pairs and prepare pairs, which look fea-
sible to annotate
5. Annotate corresponding sentences with
[AGREEMENT], [CONFLICT], [CONFINE-
MENT], or [OTHER]
1http://tsubaki.ixnlp.nii.ac.jp/
Although our target semantic relations in-
clude [EVIDENCE], they difﬁcult annotate con-
sistently, so we do not annotate them at this
time. Expanding our corpus and semantic re-
lation classiﬁer to handle [EVIDENCE] remains
and area of future work.
The data that composes our corpus comes
from a diverse number of sources. A hand sur-
vey of a random sample of the types of domains
of 100 document URLs is given below. Half of
the URL domains were not readily identiﬁable,
but the known URL domains included govern-
mental, corporate, and personal webpages. We
believe this distribution is representative of in-
formation sources on the Internet.

5.2 Experiment
Settings
In this section, we present results of empiri-
cal evaluation of our proposed semantic rela-
tion classiﬁcation system on the dataset we con-
structed in the previous section. For this experi-
ment, we use SVMs as described in Section 4.5
2http://stmap.naist.jp/corpus/ja/
index.html (in Japanese)

to classify semantic relations into one of the four
classes: [AGREEMENT], [CONFLICT], [CON-
FINEMENT], or [OTHER] in the case of no re-
lation. As data we use 370 sentence pairs that
have been manually annotated both with the cor-
rect semantic relation and with gold standard
alignments. Annotations are checked by two na-
tive speakers of Japanese, and any sentence pair
where annotation agreement is not reached is
discarded. Because we have limited data that is
annotated with correct alignments and semantic
relations, we perform ﬁve-fold cross validation,
training both the structural aligner and semantic
relation classiﬁer on 296 sentence pairs and eval-
uating on the held out 74 sentence pairs. The
ﬁgures presented in the next section are for the
combined results on all 370 sentence pairs.
5.3 Results
We compare two different approaches to classi-
ﬁcation using SVMs:
3-class semantic relations are directly classiﬁed
into one of [AGREEMENT], [CONFLICT],
and [CONFINEMENT] with all features de-
scribed in 4.5
cascaded 3-class semantic relations are ﬁrst
classiﬁed into one of [AGREEMENT], [CON-
FLICT] withoutcontextualcuefeatures. Then
an additional judgement with all features de-
termines if [AGREEMENT] and [CONFLICT]
should be reclassiﬁed as [CONFINEMENT]
Initial results using the 3-class classiﬁca-
tion model produced high f-scores for [AGREE-
MENT] but unfavorable results for [CONFLICT]
and [CONFINEMENT]. We signiﬁcantly im-
proved classiﬁcation of [CONFLICT] and [CON-
FINEMENT] by adopting the cascaded 3-class
model. We present these results in Table 2 and
successfully recognized examples in Table 1.
6 Discussion
and Error Analysis
We constructed a prototype semantic relation
classiﬁcation system by combining the compo-
nents described in the previous section. While
the system developed is not domain-speciﬁc and
capable of accepting queries on any topic, we
evaluate its semantic relation classiﬁcation on
several queries that are representative of our
training data.
Figure 3 shows a snapshot of the semantic re-
lation classiﬁcation system and the various se-
mantic relations it recognized for the query.

upper-bound alignments on semantic relation
classiﬁcation
In the example (6), recognized as [CONFINE-
MENT] in Figure 3, our system correctly identi-
ﬁed negation and analyzed the description “Xyl-
itol alone can not completely” as playing a role
of requirement.

(Xylitol alone can not completely prevent
cavities.)
Our system correctly identiﬁes [AGREE-
MENT] relations in other examples about re-
duced water from Table 1 by structurally align-
ing phrases like “promoting good health” and
“supports the health” to “good for the health.”
These examples show how resources like
(Matsuyoshi et al., 2010) and WordNet (Bond et
al., 2008) have contributed to the relation clas-
siﬁcation improvement of structural alignment
over them baseline in Table 3. Focusing on sim-
ilarity of syntactic and semantic structures gives
our alignment method greater ﬂexibility.
However, there are still various examples
which the system cannot recognized correctly.
In examples on cavity prevention, the phrase
“effective at preventing cavities” could not be
aligned with “can prevent cavities” or “good for
cavity prevention,” nor can “cavity prevention”
and “cavity-causing bacteria control.”
The above examples illustrate the importance
of the role played by the alignment phase in the
whole system’s performance.
Table 3 compares the semantic relation classi-
ﬁcation performance of using lexical alignment
only (as the baseline), lexical alignment and
structural alignment, and, to calculate the maxi-
mum possible precision, classiﬁcation using cor-
rect alignment data (the upper-bound). We can

cavities.”
see that structural alignment makes it possible to
align more words than lexical alignment alone,
leading to an improvement in semantic relation
classiﬁcation. However, there is still a large gap
between the performance of structural alignment
andthemaximumpossibleprecision. Erroranal-
ysis shows that a big cause of incorrect classiﬁ-
cation is incorrect lexical alignment. Improving
lexical alignment is a serious problem that must
be addressed. This entails expanding our cur-
rent lexical resources and ﬁnding more effective
methods of apply them in alignment.
The most serious problem we currently face is
the feature engineering necessary to ﬁnd the op-
timal way of applying structural alignments or
other semantic information to semantic relation
classiﬁcation. We need to conduct a quantita-
tive evaluation of our current classiﬁcation mod-
els and ﬁnd ways to improve them.
7 Conclusion
Classifying and identifying semantic relations
between facts and opinions on the Web is of ut-
most importance to organizing information on
the Web, however, this requires consideration of
a broader set of semantic relations than are typi-
cally handled in RTE, CST, and similar tasks. In
thispaper, weintroducedasetofcross-sentential
semantic relations speciﬁcally designed for this
task that apply over both facts and opinions. We
presented a system that identiﬁes these semantic
relations in Japanese Web texts using a combina-
tion of lexical, syntactic, and semantic informa-
tion and evaluated our system against data that
was manually constructed for this task. Prelimi-
nary evaluation showed that we are able to detect
[AGREEMENT] with high levels of conﬁdence.
Our method also shows promise in [CONFLICT]
and [CONFINEMENT] detection. We also dis-
cussed some of the technical issues that need to
be solved in order to identify [CONFLICT] and
[CONFINEMENT].
