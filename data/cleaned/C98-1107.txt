Abstract 
This paper describes a grapheme-to-phoneme 
conversion method using phoneme connectivity 
and CCV conversion rules. The method 
consists of mainly four modules including 
morpheme normalization, phrase-break detec
tion, morpheme to phoneme conversion and 
phoneme connectivity check. 
The morpheme normalization is to replace 
non-Korean symt)ols into standard Korean 
graphemes. The phrase-break detector assigns 
phrase breaks using part-of-speech (POS) 
information. In tile mort)heme-to-phoneme 
conversion module, each morpheme in the 
phrase is converted into phonetic t)atterns 
by looking up the morpheme phonetic pat
tern dictionary which contains candidate 
phonological changes in boundaries of the 
morphemes. Graphemes within a morpheme 
are grouped into CCV patterns and converted 
into phonemes by the CCV conversion rules. 
The phoneme connectivity table supports 
grarnmaticality checking of the adjacent two 
phonetic morphemes. 
In tile experiments with a cortms of 4,973 
sentences, we achieved 99.9% of the grapheme
to-phoneme conversion performance and 97.5% 
of the sentence conversion performance. The 
full Korean TTS system is now being imple
mented using this conversion method. 
1 Introduction

During the past few years, remarkable improve
ments have been made for high-quality text
to-speech systems (van Santen et al., 1997). 
One of the enduring problems in developing 
high-quality text-to-speech system is accurate 
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (Divay and 
Vitale, 1997). it can be described as a function 
mat)ping the si)elling of words to their t)honetic 
symbols. Nevertheless, tile fimction in some al
phabetic languages needs some linguistic knowl
edge, especially morphological and phonologi
cal, but often also semantic knowledge. 
In this paper, we present a new grapheme-to
phoneme conversion Inethod for mflimited vo
cabulary Korean TTS. The conversion method 
is divided into mainly tbur modules. Each mod
ule has its own linguistic knowledge. Phrase
break detection module assigns phrase breaks 
onto part-of-speech sequences using mort)ho
logical knowledge. Word-boundaries before 
and alter phrase breaks should not be co
articulated. So, accurate phrase-break assign
ments are essential in high quality TTS sys
tems. In the morpheme-to-phoneme conver
sion module, boundary graphemes of each mor
pheme in the phrase are converted to phonemes 
by applying phonetic patterns which contain 
possible phonological changes in the boundaries 
of nmrphemes. The patterns arc designed us
ing morphological and phonotactic knowledge. 
Graphemes within a morpheme are converted 
into phonemes by CCV (consonant consonant 
vowel) conversion rules which are automatically 
extracted from a corpus. After all the conver
sions, phoneme connectivity table supports the 
grammaticality of the adjacency of two phonetic 
morphemes. This grammaticality comes from 
Korean phonology rules. 
This pat)er is organized as tbllows. Section 2 
briefly explains the characteristics of spoken Ko
rean for general readers. Section 3 and 4 in
troduces our graphcme-to-phoneme conversion 
method based on morphological and phonolog
ical knowledge of Korean. Section 5 shows 
experiment results to demonstrate the perfor
mance and Section 6 draws sonm conclusions.

2 Features
of Spoken Korean 
This section briefly explains the linguistic char
acteristics of spoken Korean before describing 
the architecture. 
A Korean word (called eojeol) consists of more 
than one morpheme with clear-cut morpheme 
boundaries (Korean is an agglutinative lan
guage). Korean is a postpositional language 
with many kinds of noun-endings, verb-endings, 
and prefinal verb-endings. These functional 
morphemes determine the noun's case roles, 
verb's aspect/tenses, modals, and modification 
relations between words. The unit of pause in 
speech (phrase break) is usually different from 
that in written text. No phonological change 
occur between these phrase breaks. Phonologi
cal changes can occur in a morpheme, between 
morphemes in a word, and even between words 
in a phrase break as described in the 30 general 
phonological rules for Korean(Korean Ministry 
of Education, 1995). These changes include con
sonant and vowel assimilation, dissimilation, in
sertion, deletion, and contraction. For exam
ple, noun "kag-ryo" pronounced as "kangnyo" 
(meaning "cabinet") is an example of phono
logical change within a morpheme. Noun 
plus noun-ending "such+gwa", in which "such" 
means "charcoal" and "gwa" means "and" in 
English, is sounded as "sudggwa", which is 
an example of the inter-morpheme phonologi
cal change. "Ta-seos gae", which means "five 
items", is sounded as "taseot ggae", in which 
phonological changes occur between words. In 
addition, phonological changes can occur condi
tionally on the morphotactic environments but 
also on phonotactic environments. 
3 Architecture
of the 
Grapheme-to-Phoneme Converter 
Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a basic step 
to the grapheme-to-phoneme conversion since 
phonological changes depend on morphotactic 
and phonotactic environments. The POS tag
ging system have to handle out-of-vocabulary 
(OOV) words for accurate grapheme-to
phoneme conversion of unlimited vocabulary 
(Bechet and E1-Beze, 1997). Figure 1 shows 
the architecture of our grapheme-to-phoneme 
converter integrated with the hybrid POS 
tagging system (Lee et al., 1997). The hybrid 
POS tagging system employs generalized OOV 
word handling mechanisms in the morpho
logical analysis, and cascades statistical and 
rule-based approaches in the two-phase training 
architecture for POS disambiguation.

Figure 1: Architecture of the grapheme-to
phoneme converter in TTS applications 
Each morpheme tagged by the POS tagger 
is normalized by replacing non-Korean symbols 
by Korean graphemes to expand numbers, ab
breviations, and acronyms. The phrase-break 
detector segments the POS sequences into sev
eral phrases according to phrase-break detec
tion rules. In the phoneme converter, each mor
pheme in the phrase is converted into phoneme 
sequences by consulting the morpheme pho
netic dictionary. The OOV morphemes which 
are not registered in the morpheme phonetic 
dictionary should be processed in two differ
ent ways. The graphemes in the morpheme 
boundary are converted into phonemes by con
suiting the morpheme phonetic pattern dictio
nary. The graphemes within morphemes are 
converted into phonemes according to CCV con
version rules. To model phoneme's connectabli
ties between morpheme boundaries, the sepa
rate phoneme connectivity table encodes the 
phonological changes between the morpheme 
with their POS tags. Outputs of the grapheme
to-phoneme converter, that is, phoneme se
676 
quences of the input sentence, can be directly 
fed to the lower level signal processing module 
of TTS systems. Next section will give detail de
scriptions of each component of the grapheme
to-phoneme converter. The hybrid POS tagging 
system will not be explained in this paper, and 
interested readers can see the reference (Lee et 
al., 1997). 
4 Component
Descriptions of the 
Converter 
4.1 Morpheme
Normalization 
The normalization replaces non-Korean sym
bols by corresponding Korean graphemes. Nora 
Korean symbols include mnnbers (e.g. 54, 
12, 5,400, 4.2), dates (e.g. 20/1/97, 20-Jan
97), times (e.g. 12:46), scores (e.g. 74:64), 
mathematical expressions (e.g. 4+5, 1/3), tele
phone nmnbers, abbreviations (e.g. kin, ha) and 
acronyms (e.g. UNESCO, OECD). Especially, 
acronyms have two types: spelled acronyms 
such as OECD and prononnced ones like a word 
such as UNESCO. 
The numbers are converted into the correspond
i:ng Korean graphemes using deterministic fi
nite autolnata. The dates, times, scores, ex
pressions and telephone numbers are converted 
into eqnivahmt graphemes using their formats 
and values. The abbreviations and acronyms 
are enrolled in the morpheme phonetic dictio
nary, and converted into the phonemes using 
the mort)heine-to-phoneme conversion module. 
4.:1 Phrase-Break Detection 
Phrase-I)reak boundaries are important to 
the subsequent processing such as morpheme
to-phoneme conversion and prosodic feature 
generation. Graphemes in phrase-break 
boundaries are not phonologically changed 
and sounded as their original corresponding 
phonemes in Korean. 
A number of different algorithms have been 
suggested and implemented for phrase break 
detection (Black and Taylor, 1997). The 
simplest algorithm uses determiifistic rules and 
more complicated algorithms can use syntactic 
knowledge and even semantic knowledge. We 
designed simple rules using break and POS 
tagged corpus. We tbund that, ii1 Korean, the 
~verage hmgth of phrases is 5.6 words and over 
90% of breaks are alter 6 different POS tags: 
conjunctive ending, auxiliary particle, case 
particle, other particle, adverb and adnominal 
ending. The phrase-break detector assigns 
breaks after these 6 POS tags considering the 
length of phrases. 
4.3 Morpheme-to-Phoneme Conversion 
The morphemes registered in the mortflmme, 
phonetic dictionary can be directly converted 
into phonemes by consulting the dictionary en
tries. However, separate method to process the 
OOV morphemes which are not registered in the 
dictionary is necessary. We developed a new 
method as shown Figure 2.

The mori)heme phonetic dictionary contains 
POS tag, morphenm, phoneme connectivity 
(left and right) and t)honeme sequence tbr each 
entry. We try to register nfinimmn nmnber 
of morpheme in the dictionary. So it contains 
only the morphemes which are diificult to pro
cess using the next OOV morpheme conversion 
modules. Table 1 shows example entries for 
the common noun "pang-gabs", ineaning "price 
of a room" in hotel reservation dialogs. The 
common noun "pang-gabs" can be pronounced 
as "pang-ggam", "pang-ggab" or "pang-ggabss" 
according to first phoneme of the adjacent too> 
phelnes. 
To handle the OOV morphemes, morpheme 
phonetic pattern dictionary is developed to con
tain all the general patterns of Korean POS 
tags, morphemes, phoneme connectivity and 
phoneme sequences. Boundary phonemes of 
the OOV morphemes can be converted to their 
candidate phonemes, and the phonological con
nectivity for theln can be acquired by consult
ing this morpheme phonetic pattern dictionary.

phoneme, vowel, any character sequence with 
variable length in the order. The table shows 
that the first grapheme 't' can be phonologically 
changed to 'tt' according to the last phoneme 
of the preceding morpheme (left connectivity), 
and the last grapheme 'd' can be phonologically 
changed to 'n' according to the first phoneme 
of the following morpheme(right connectivity). 
The morpheme phonetic pattern dictionary con
tains similar 1,992 entries to model the general 
phonological rules for Korean. 
The graphemes within a morpheme for OOV 
morphemes are converted into phonemes using 
the CCV conversion rules. The CCV conversion 
rules are the mapping rules between grapheme 
to phoneme in character tri-gram forms which 
are in the order of consonant(C) consonant(C) 
vowel(V) spanning two consecutive syllables. 
The CCV rules are designed and automatically 
learned from a corpus reflecting the following 
Korean phonological facts. 
• Korean is a syllable-base language, i.e., 
Korean syllable is the basic unit of the 
graphemes and consists of first consonant, 
vowel and final consonant (CVC). 
• The number of possible consonants for 
each syllable can be varied in grapheme
to-phoneme conversion. 
• The number of vowels for each syllable is 
not changed. 
• Phonological changes of the first consonant 
are only affected by the final consonant 
of the preceding syllable and the following 
vowel of the same syllable. 
• Phonological changes of the final consonant 
are only affected by the first consonant of 
the following syllable. 
• Phonological changes of the vowel are not 
affected by the following consonant. 
The boundary graphemes of the OOV mor
phemes are phonologically changed according 
to the POS tag and the boundary graphemes 
of the preceding and following morphemes. On 
the other hand, the inner grapheme conversion 
is not affected by the POS tag, but only by 
the adjacent graphemes within the same mor
pheme. The CCV conversion rules can model 
the fact easily, but the conventional CC conver
sion rules (Park and Kwon, 1995) cannot model 
the influence of the vowels. 
4.4 Phoneme
Connectivity Check 
To verify the boundary phonemes' con
nectablity to one another, the separate phoneme 
connectivity table encodes the phonologically 
connectable pair of each morpheme which has 
phonologically changed boundary graphemes. 
This phoneme connectivity table indicates the 
grammatical sound combinations in Korean 
678 
phonology using the defined left and right con
nectivity information. 
The morpheme-to-phoneme conversion can gen
erate a lot of phoneme sequence candidates tbr 
single morpheme. We put the whole phoneme ,~equence candidates in a phoneme graph where 
a correct phoneme sequence path can be se
lected for input sentence. The phoneme connec
tivity check performs this selection and prunes 
the ungrammatical phoneme sequences in the 
graph. 
5 Implementation
and Experiment 
Results 
We implenlented simple phrase-break detection 
rules from break and POS tagged corpus col
lected from recording and transcribing broad
casting news. The rules reflect the fact that av
erage length of phrases in Korean is 5.6 words 
and over 90% of breaks are after 6 specific POS 
tags, described in the texts. 
We constructed a 1,992 entry morpheme pho
netic pattern dictionary for OOV morpheme 
processing using standard Korean phonological 
rules. The morpheme phonetic dictionary was 
(:onstructed for only the morphemes that are 
difficult to handle with these standard rules. 
The two dictionaries are indexed using POS 
tag and morpheme pattern for fast access, rib 
model the boundary phonemes' connectablity 
to one another, the phoneme connectivity table 
encodes 626 pair of phonologically connectable 
morphemes. 
The 2030 entry rule set for CCV conversion was 
automatically learned fl'om phonetically tran
scribed 9,773 sentences. The independent pho
netically transcribed 4,973 sentences are used 
to test the performance of the grapheme-to
phoneme conversion. Of the 4,973 sentence% 
only 2.5% are incorrectly processed (120 sen
tences out of 4,973), and only 0.1% of the 
graphemes in the sentences are actually incor
rectly converted. 
6 Conclusions

This paper presents a new grapheme-to
phoneme conversion method using phoneme 
connectivity and CCV conversion rules for un
limited vocabulary Korean TTS. For the effi
cient conversion, new ideas of morpheme pho
netic and morpheme phonetic pattern dictio
nary are invented and tile system demom 
strates remarkable conversion perfbrmance for 
the unlimited vocabulary texts. Our main con
tributions include presenting the morpholog
ically and phonologically conditioned conver
sion model which is essential for morpholog
ically and phonologically complex agglutina
tive languages. The other contribution is the 
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion model coin
blued with the declarative phonological rule 
which is well suited to the given task. We 
also designed new CCV unit of graphemc-to
phoneme conversion for unlimited vocabulary 
task. The experiments show that grapheme
to-phoneme conversion performance is 97.5% 
in sentence conversion, and 99.9% in each 
grapheme conversion. We are now working on 
incorporating this grapheme-to-phonenm con
version into the developing TTS systems.
