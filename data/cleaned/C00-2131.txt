Finding Structural Correspondences from Bilingual Parsed Corpus for Corpus-b sed Translation Hideo Watanabe*, Sadao Kurohashi** and Eiji Aramaki** * IBM Researdt, Tokyo Research Laboratory 1623-14 Shimotsuruma, Yamato, Kanagawa 242-8502, Japan watanabe@trl.ibm.co.jp ** Graduate School of Inforlnatics, Kyoto University Yoshida-homnachi, Sakyo, Kyoto 606-8501,.JaI)an kuro@i.kyoto-u.ac.jp, aramaki@pine.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp Abstract In this paper, we describe a system and methods for finding structural correspondences from the paired dependency structures of a source sentence and its translation in a target language.
The system we have developed finds word correspondences first, then finds phrasal correspon(tences based on word correspondences.
We have also developed a GUI system with which a user can check and correct tile correspondences retrieved by the system.
These structural correspondences will be used as raw translation I)atterns in a corpus-based translation system.
1 Introduction
So far, a number of methodologies and systelns for machine trauslation using large corpora exist.
They include example-based at)proaches \[7, 8, 9, 12\], pattern-based approaches \[10, 11, 14\], and statistical approaches.
For instance, example-based approaches use a large set of translation patterns each of which is a pair of parsed structures of a source-language fragment and its target-language translation fragment.
Figure 1 shows an exanlple of translation by an example-based method, ill which translation patterns (pl) and (p2) are selected as similar to a (left hand) Japanese dependency structure, and an (right hand) English dependency structure is constructed by merging the target parts of these translation patterns 1.
In this kind of system, it is very important to collect a large set of translatiou patterns easily and efficiently.
Previous systems, however, collect such translation patterns mostly manually.
Therefore, they have problems in terms of the development cost.
1Words in parenthesis at the nodes of the Japanese dependency structure are representative English translations, and are for explanation.
This paper tries to provide solutions for this issue by proposing methods for finding structural correspondences of parsed trees of a translation pair.
These structural correspondences are used as bases of translation patterns in corpus-based approaches.
Figure 2 shows an example of extracting structural correspondences.
In this figure, tile left tree is a Japanese dependency tree, the right tree is a dependency tree of its English translation, dotted arrows represent word correspondence, and a pair of boxes connected by a solid line represent phrasal correspondence.
We would like to extract these,ook \ "4"-..~ ...," ~..

In what follows, we will describe details of procedures for finding these structural correspondences.
2 Finding
Structural Correspondences This sectiou describes methods for finding structural correspondences for a paired parsed trees.
2.1 Data
Structure Before going into the details of finding structural correspondences, we describe the data format of a 906 verb -9a noun--noun, n0mu--drink ll0un -n0un verb ! i,, t.
"', dl lk he .__medicine l 1 ~ # \[.-I (p2) Figure 1: Translation Example by Examt)le-based ~li'anslation dependency structure.
A det)endeney stru('ture as used in this pat)er is a tree consisting of nodes and links (or m:cs), wh('.re a node represents a content word, while a link rel)resents a fllnctional word or a relation between content words.
For instance, as shown in Figure 2, a t)reposition "at;" is represented as a link in l~,nglish.
2.2 Finding
Word Correspondences The tirst task for finding stru('tm:al corresI)Onden(:c's is to lind word (:orro, sl)ondenccs t)et;ween (;he nodes of a sour(:e parsed tree and the nodes of a t;wget parsed tree.
Word correspondences are tkmn(1 by eonsull;ing a source-to-target translation dictionary.
Most words can find a unique 1;ranslation candidate in a target tree, but there are cases such that there are many translation candidates in a target parsed tree for a source word.
Theretbre, the main task of tinding word correspondences is to determine the most plausible l;ranslation word mnong can(tidates.
We call a pair of a source word and its translation candidate word in a target tree a word correspondence candidate denoted by WC(s,/,), where s is a source word and t is a target word.
If 17\[TC(s,/,) ix a word correspondence candida.te such that there is rto other WC originating h'om s, then it is called WA word correspondence.
The basic idea to select the most plausil)le word correspondence candidate ix to select a candidate which is near to another word correspondence whose source is also near to a sour(:e word in question.
Suppose a source word s has multiple candidate translation target words t~ (i = 1,...,7~,), that is, there are multiple 17FCs originating h'om .s'.
We, denote these multiple word corresl)ondence candidates by WC(s, tl).
For each I'VC of s, this procedure finds the neighbor WA correspondence whose distance to WC ix below a threshold.
The distance between WC(sl,/,~) and WA(s.2,/,2) is defined as the distance between sl and .s2 plus the distmme between s2 and 1,2 where a distance between two nodes is defined as the number of nodes in the t)ath whoso, ends are the two nodes.
Among I~VCs of .s for which neighbor H/A ix tound, the one with the smallest (listan(:(~ is chosen as the word correSl)ondenee of s, and I/VCs whMl are not chosen are invalidated (or deleted).
We call a word correspondence found t)y this procedure WX.
We use 3 as t;he distance threshold of the above procedure currently.
This procedure ix applied to all source nodes which have multii)le WCs.
Figure 3 shows an example of WX word correspondence.
In this examt)le, since the Japanese word "ki" has two English l;ranslation word candidates "time" and "period," there are two WCs (~7C 1 and WC2).
The direct parent node "ymlryo" of "ki" has a WA correspondence (I/VA1) to "concern," and the direct child node "ikou" has also a WA correspondc'nee (WA2) to "transition".
In this ease, since the distance between I'VC2 and WA2 is smaller than the distan(:e between I.VC1 and WA1, I'VC~ in clmnged to a 1/l/X, and I~ITC1 is adandoned.
In addition to WX correspondences, we consider a special case such that given a word correspondence l'lZ(s,/,), if s has only one child node which ix 907 .., ........ be .......

VVA2 of transition (transition) Figure 3: An Exmnt)le of WX Word Correst)on(lence a leaf and t has also only one child node which ix a leaf, th(;n we COllStrllet a lleW word correspondence called 1US from these two leaf nodes.
This WE procedure is al)plied to all word correspondences.
Note tlmt this word correst)ondence is not to se.le, ct one of candidates, rather it is a new finding of word corre, spondence by utilizing a special structm:e.
For instance, in Figure 3, if there is a word eorrespol> dence 1)etween "ki" and "period" and there is no word correst)ondence between "ikou" and "transition," then I<V,g(iko'u~ transition) will be found 1)3' this 1)roeedure.
These WX and WS t)rocedures are continuously al)plied until no new word correspondences arc t'(mnd.
Aft;er al)l)lying the above WX and I'VS pro(:edures, there are some target words t such that t is a destination of a l,l/C(.s ", t) and there ix no other 1,176, whose destination ix t:.
In this case, the lUG(s,t) correspondence candidate is chosen as a valid word correspondence between s and/,, and it; is called a HzZ word eorrest)ondence.
We call a source node or a target node of a word correspondence an anchor node in what tbllows.
The above t)rocedures for finding word corresI)ondences are summarized as follows: Find WCs by consulting translation dictionary; Find WAs; while (true) { find WXs; find WSs; if no new word corresp, is found, then break; } find WZs; 2.3 Finding Phrasal Col'resl)ondences The next step is to tind phrasal correspondences based on word eorl'eSl)ondences t'(mnd t) 3, 1)roce.dures described in tim previous section.
What we would like to retrieve here, is a set of phrasal correspondences which (:overs all elements of a paired dependency trees.
In what follows, we (:all a portion of a tree which consists of nodes in a 1)att~ from a node ?t I (;o alloth(;r node nu which is a descen(lanl; of n:l a lin-.
ear tree denoted by LT(v,1, n~), and we denote a minimal sul)tree including st)coiffed nodes hi, ..., n.~, l)y T(nl,...,n,).
For instan(:(,~ in the English tree structure (the right tree) in Figure 4, LT(tcch, nology, science) is a rectangular area covering %eclmol• tg "e e ~ ogy," and SOl,no,, anti .T(J'acl;or, cou'ntrjl ) is a 1)olygonal area covering "factor,""atDcl,, .... t)olicy," and "country".
The tirst step is to find a 1)air of word correst)ondences W, (.~'~, t,) and ~4q(.,.~, t,~) such that .,, a.,t s2 constructs a linear tree LT(si, s2) and there is no anchor node in th(' 1)al;h from s~ to s2 other than .s'~ and .s2, where 1UI and H~ denote any tyi)e of word ('orrest)on(lences 2 and we assmne there is a word corresI)ondence t)etwee, n roots of source and (;arget trees by defmflt.
We construct a t)hrasal correspondence fi'om source nodes in LT(s,,s2) and target l/o(les itl r\]'(t:l,/'2), (l()llote(t by \];'(l~,~F'(.q'l, .";2), 5\].n(tl, t2)).
For illstall('e~ ill Figllre 41~ \]"11~ \]~12~ 1)'2~ 1)3 and \])4 tu.'e source portions of phrasal et)rrespondences found in this step.
The next stel) checks, for ea(:h 1', if all anchor llo(les of wor(1 eorres1)Oll(leile(?s wllose SOUlT(;e o1 ~;alget node is included in P are al,eo included in P.
If a t)hrasal correst)ondenee satisiies this condition, then it is called closed, otherwise it ix called open.
Further, nodes which are not included in the I ) in question are called open nodes.
If a l ) ix ot)en, then it ix merged with other 1)hrasal correspondences having ol)en nodes of P so that the merged 1)hrasal correspondence becomes (-losed.
Next, each P~,, is checked if there is another l)q which shares any nodes ottmr than anchor nodes with P.,,.
If this is the case, these P:., and 1~ are lnerged into one phrasal correspondence.
In Figure 4, t)hrasal correspondences i 11 and P12 are merged into P1, since their source I)ortions LT (haikei, koku) and LT (haikci, seisaku) share "doukou" which is not an anchor node.
Finally, any path whose nodes other than the root are not included in any 1)s but the root node ix included in a 1 ) is searched for.
This procedure 2Since WC is not a word correspondence (it is a candidate, of word corresi)ondence), it is llOi; conside, red here.

A im.th found 1)y this 1)ro(:(xlur(~ is called an open pal, h,, m~(t its root no(le is called a pivot.
If such an Ol)en path is found, it is t)rocessed as follows: l, br each 1)ivot node, (a) if the t)ivot is not an mmhor nod(;, then open lmths originating fl:om the pivot is merged into a 1 ) having I;he pivot, (b) if the pivot is an ~LIlChOf llo(lo~ {;hOll 3_ llOW t)hl'~lS~L1 c()rFos1)oII(|(~IlC( ~, iS created from Ol)(m 1)ai;hs originating from the m> thor nodes of the word (:orrcsl)on(l(:ncc.

LTX is a special case of LTY, since Sl and tl of LTX must have only one child node, on the other hand, ones of LTY may have more than two child nodes.
A subcategory test tbr a phrasal correspondence is done in the above order.
Exmnples of these subcategories are shown in Fig 5.
Tlm result of these subcategories are also shown in Table 2.
Subcategories MIN and LTX have very high accuracy and this result is very promising, since we can avoid nmnual checking for ttmse phrasal correst)ondences, or we would check only these types of t)hrasal correspondences mmmally and discard other types.
As stated earlier, since we removed only sentences with severe parsing errors from the test set, please note that the above mtmbers of experimental results are calculated for a bilingual parsed corpus including parsing errors.
4 Discussion
There have been some studies on structural alignInent of bilingual texts such as \[1, 4, 13, 3, 6\].
Our work is similar to these previous studies at the conceptual level, but different in some aspects.
\[1\] reported a method for extracting translation templates by CKY parsing of bilingual sentences.
This work is to get phrase-structure level phrasal correspondences, but our work is to get dependencystructure level phrasal correspondences.
\[4\] proposed a method for extracting structural matclfing (pairs of dependency trees) by calculating matching similarities of two dependency structures.
Their work focuses on tile parsing ambiguity resolution by calculating structural matching.
Further, \[3, 6\] proposed structural alignnmnt of dependency structures.
Their work assuined tha.t least common ancestors of each fragment of a structural correspondence are preserved, but our work does not have such structural restriction.
\[13\] is different to others in that it tries to find phrasal correspondences by comt)aring a MT result and its manual correction.
In addition to these differences, the main difference is to find classes (or categories) of phrasal correspondences which have high accuracy.
In general, since bilingual structural alignment is very complicated and difficult task, it; is very hard to get more than 90% accuracy in total.
If we get only such an accuracy rate, the result is not useful, since we need manual clmcks tbr the all correspondences retrieved.
But, if we can get some classes of phrasal correspondence with, for instance, more than 90% accuracy rate, then we can reduce manual clmcking for phrasal correspondences in such classes, and this reduces the development cost of translation patterns used in later corpus-based translation protess.
As shown in the previous section, we could find ttmt all (:lasses of word correspondences and two subclasses of phrasal correspondences are more than 90% accurate.
When actually using this automatically retrieved structural correspondence data, we must consider how to manually correct the incomplete parts and how to reuse mamlal correction data if the parser results are ctmnged.
As for the tbrlner issue, we need an easy-to-use tool to modify correspondences to reduce the cost of mmmal operation.
We have developed a GUI tool as shown in Figure 6.
In this figure, the bottom half presents a pair of source and target dependency structures with word correspondences (solid lines) and phrasal correspondences (sequences of slmded circles).
You can easily correct correspondences by looking at this graplfical presentation.
As for tlm latter issue, we must develop methods for reusing the manual correction data as much as possible even if tim parser outputs are changed.
We have developed a tool for attaching phrasal correspondences by using existing phrasal cormspondence data.
This is implemented as follows: Each phrasal correspondence is assigned a signature which is a pair of source and target, sentences, each of which tins bracketed segments which are included in the phrasal correspondence.

(/.~io) In the above e, xample, segments betwee, n '\[' and '\]' represent a phrasal correspondence.
If new parsed dqmndency structures for a sentence pair is given, for each phrasal correspondence signature of the sentence pair, nodes in the structures wtfich are inside 1)rackets of the signature are marked, mid if there is a minimal sul)tree consisting of only marked nodes, then a phrasal correSl)ondence is reconstructed from the phrasal correspondence signature.
By using this tool, we can efficiently reuse the manual efforts as much as possible even if parsers are updated.
5 Conclusion
Ill this I)al)er, we have t)rol)osed methods for finding structural correspondences (word correst)ondences and i)hrasal corr(;spondences) of bilingual parsed corpus.
Further, we showed that the t)recision of word correst)ond(mces and some catc'gories of t)hrasal corresl)ondences found 1)y our methods are highly accurate, and these correst)ondences can reduce the cost of trm~slation pattern accumulation.
In addition to these results, we showed a GUI tool for mmmal correction and a tool for reusing previous correspondence data.
As fld;ure directions, we will find more subclasses with high accuracy to reduce the cost for translation pattern preparation.
We believe that these methods and tools can accelerate the collection of a large set of translation patterns and the developlnent of a corlms-based translation system.
