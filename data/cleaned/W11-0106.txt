Abstract
This paper presents a model to compose semantic relations. The model is independent of any
particular set of relations and uses an extended definition for semantic relations. This extended def-
inition includes restrictions on the domain and range of relations and utilizes semantic primitives
to characterize them. Primitives capture elementary properties between the arguments of a relation.
An algebra for composing semantic primitives is used to automatically identify the resulting rela-
tion of composing a pair of compatible relations. Inference axioms are obtained. Axioms take as
input a pair of semantic relations and output a new, previously ignored relation. The usefulness of
this proposed model is shown using PropBank relations. Eight inference axioms are obtained and
their accuracy and productivity are evaluated. The model offers an unsupervised way of accurately
extracting additional semantics from text.
1 Introduction
Semantic representation of text is an important step toward text understanding, performing inferences
and reasoning. Potentially, it could dramatically improve the performance of several Natural Language
Processing applications.
Semantic relations have been studied in linguistics for decades. They are unidirectional underlying
connections between concepts. For example, the sentence The construction slowed down the traffic
encodes a CAUSE and detecting it would help answer the question Why is traffic slower?
In Computational Linguistics, there have been several proposals to detect semantic relations. Current
approaches focus on a particular set of relations and given a text they output relations. There have
been competitions aiming at detecting semantic roles (i.e., relations between a verb and its arguments)
(Carreras and M`arquez, 2005), and between nominals (Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx et al., 2009).
In this paper, we propose a model to compose semantic relations to extract previously ignored rela-
tions. The model allows us to automatically obtain inference axioms given a set of relations and is not
coupled to any particular set. Axioms take as their input semantic relations and yield a new semantic
relation as their conclusion.

2 Semantic
Relations
Semantic relations are the underlying relations between concepts expressed by words or phrases. In other
words, semantic relations are implicit associations between concepts in text.
In general, a semantic relation is defined by stating the kind of connection linking two concepts. For
example, Hendrickx et al. (2009) loosely define ENTITY-ORIGIN as an entity is coming or is derived from
an origin (e.g., position or material) and give one example: Earth is located in the Milky Way. We find
this kind of definition weak and prone to confusion.
Following Helbig (2005), we propose an extended definition for semantic relations, including seman-
tic restrictions for its domain and range. For example, DOMAIN(AGENT) must be an animate concrete
object and RANGE(AGENT) must be a situation.
Moreover, weproposetocharacterizerelationsbysemanticprimitives. Primitivesindicateifacertain
property holds between the arguments of a relation. For example, the primitive temporal indicates if the
first argument must happen before the second in order for the relation to hold. This primitive holds for
CAUSE (a cause must precede its effect) and it does not apply to PART-WHOLE since the later relation
does not consider time.
Besides having a better understanding of each relation, this extended definition allows us to create a
model that automatically obtains inference axioms for composing semantic relations. The model detects
possible combinations of relations and identifies the conclusion of composing them.
Formally, we represent a relation R as R(x, y), where R is the relation type and x and y are the first
and second argument respectively. R(x, y) should be read x is R of Y. DOMAIN(R) and RANGE(R) are the
sorts of concepts that can be part of the first and second argument respectively. Any ontology can be used
to define domains and ranges, e.g., Helbig (2005) defined one to define a set of 89 relations. Primitives
are represented by an array PR of length n, where n is the number of primitives and PiR indicates the
value R takes for the ith primitive.
The inverse of R is denoted R−1 and can be obtained by simply switching the arguments of R. Given
R(x, y), R−1(y, x) always holds. We can easily define R−1 given the definition for R: DOMAIN(R−1) =
RANGE(R), RANGE(R−1) = DOMAIN(R), and PR−1 is defined according to the fourth column of Table
1 for each primitive, i.e., nulli null [1,n] : PiR−1 = Inverse(PiR).
2.1 Semantic
Primitives
Relation primitives capture deep characteristics of relations. Huhns and Stephens (1989) define them as:
They[primitives]areindependentlydeterminableforeachrelationandrelativelyself-explanatory.
They specify a relationship between an element of the domain and an element of the range
of the semantic relation being described.
Relation primitives are fundamental properties that cannot be explained using other primitives; they are
elemental. They specify basic attributes of a relation by stating if a particular property must hold by
definition between the domain and range.
Each relation takes a value for each primitive from the set V = null+,null,0null, where ‘+’ indicates that
the property holds, ‘null’ that it does not hold and ‘0’ that it does not apply. For example, the primitive
volitional indicates if a relation requires volition between domain and range. AGENT takes as value +
for this primitive and PART-WHOLE takes 0.
Primitives complement the definition of a relation by stating if a particular property holds between its
arguments. They help to understand the inter-relation differences and clustering relations. Primitives can
be used as conditions to be fulfilled in order to determine if a potential relation holds. They are general
enough to be determined for a relation, not a particular instantiation. In other words, they state properties
that hold for all instances of a relation by definition.
Oursetofprimitives(Table1)isinspiredonpreviousworkinKnowledgeBases(HuhnsandStephens,
1989). We only select from them useful primitives for our purpose and add more primitives. The
additional primitives are justified by the fact that we aim at combining relations capturing semantics

from natural language. Whatever the set of chosen relations, it will describe the characteristics of
events (who/when/where/how something happened), which elements were involved, connections be-
tween events (e.g. CAUSE, CORRELATION). Time (whether an argument is guaranteed to happen before
than the other), space and volition (whether or not there must be volition between the arguments) also
play an important role.
The fourth column in Table 1 indicates the value of the primitive for the inverse relation. Same means
the inverse relation takes the same value, opposite means it takes the opposite. The opposite of null is +,
the opposite of null is +, and the opposite of 0 is 0.

i.e., AGENT(x, y)doesnotrequire x and y tobeconnected anditrequiresvolitionbetweenthearguments.
Note that PAGENT−1 = PAGENT.
2.2 An
Algebra for Composing Semantic Relations
The key to automatically obtaining inference axioms is the ability to know beforehand the result of
composing semantic primitives using an algebra. This way, one can identify prohibited combinations of
relations and determine conclusions for the composition of valid combinations.
47
Given PiR1 and PiR2, i.e., the values of R1 and R2 for a primitive pi, we define an algebra that indicates
the result of composing them (i.e., PiR1 null PiR2). Composing two primitives can yield three values: +, null
or 0, indicating if the primitive holds, does not hold or does not apply to the composition of R1 and R2.
Additionally, the composition can be prohibited, indicated with null. After composing all the primitives
for R1 and R2, we obtain the primitives values for the composition of R1 and R2 (i.e., PR1 nullPR2).
We define the values for the composition using a table for each primitive. Table 2 depicts the whole
algebra. The ith table indicates the rules for composing the ith primitive. For example, regarding the
intrinsic primitive, we have the following rules:
null If both relations are intrinsic, the composition is intrinsic;
null else if intrinsic does not apply to either relation, the primitive does not apply to the composition;
null else, the composition is not intrinsic.
Other rules stated by the algebra are: (1) two relations shall not compose if they have different
opposite values for the primitive temporal; (2) the composition of R1 and R2 is not separable if either
relation is not separable; and (3) if either R1 or R2 are connected, then the composition is connected.
3 Necessary
Conditions for Composing Semantic Relations
In principle, one could define axioms for every single possible combination of relations. However, there
are two necessary conditions in order to compose R1 and R2:
1. They have to be compatible. A pair of relations is compatible if it is possible, from a theo-
retical point of view, to compose them. Formally, R1 and R2 are compatible iff RANGE(R1) null
DOMAIN(R2) null= null.
2. A third relation R3 must fit as conclusion, that is, nullR3 such that DOMAIN(R3)nullDOMAIN(R1) null= null
and RANGE(R3) null RANGE(R2) null= null.
Furthermore, PR3 must be compatible with the result of composing PR1 and PR2.
It is important to note that domain and range compatibility is not enough to compose two relations.
For example, given KINSHIP(Mary, John) and AT-LOCATION(John, Dallas), no relation can be inferred
between Mary and Dallas.
4 Inference
Axioms
An axiom is defined as a set of relations called premises and a conclusion. The composition operator null
is the basic way of combining two relations to form an axiom. We denote an inference axiom as R1(x, y)
null R2(y, z) null R3(x, z), where R1 and R2 are the premises and R3 the conclusion. In order to instantiate
an axiom the premises must have an argument in common, y.
In general, for n relations there are parenleftbign2parenrightbig = n(n−1)2 different pairs. For each pair, taking into account
the two relations and their inverses, there are 4 null 4 = 16 different possible combinations.
We note that R1 null R2 = (R2−1 null R1−1)−1, reducing the total number of different combinations to
10. Out of these 10, (1) 4 combine R1, R2 and their inverses (Table 3); (2) 3 combine R1 and its inverse;
and (3) 3 combine R2 and its inverse. The most interesting combinations to use as premises for an axiom
fall into category (1), since the other two can be resolved by the transitivity property of a relation and its
inverse. Therefore, for n relations there are 2n2+n potential axioms: parenleftbign2parenrightbignull4+3n = 2nulln(nnull1)+3n =
2n2 null 2n + 3n = 2n2 + n.
4.1 An
Algorithm for Obtaining Inference Axioms
Given a set of relations R defined using the extended definition, one can automatically obtain inference
axioms using the following steps for each pair of relations R1 null R and R2 null R, where R1 null= R2:

The method consistent(P1,P2) is a simple procedure that compares the values assigned to each
primitive one by one. Two values for the same primitive are compatible unless they have different
opposites or either value is ‘null’ (i.e., prohibited).
5 Case
Study: PropBank
PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) adds a layer of predicate-argument information, or semantic role labels,
on top of the syntactic trees provided by the Penn TreeBank. Along with FrameNet, it is the resource
most widely used for semantic role annotation.
PropBank uses a series of numeric core roles (ARG0 ARG5) and a set of more general roles, ARGMs
(e.g. MTMP, MLOC, MMNR). The interpretation of the numeric roles is determined by a verb-specific
framesets, although ARG0 and ARG1 usually correspond to the prototypical AGENT and THEME. On the
other hand, the meaning of AGRMs generalize across verbs.
An example of PropBank annotation is the following: [Winston]ARG0 [procrastinated]rel [a lot]MADV
[due to his nervous demeanor]MCAU. Palmer et al. (2005) discuss the creation of PropBank. For more
information about the semantics of each role, we refer the reader to the annotation guidelines1.
Since ARG2, AGR3, ARG4 and ARG5 do not have a common meaning across verbs, they become not
composable. For example, ARG2 is used for INSTRUMENT in the frameset kick.01 and for BENEFACTIVE
in the frameset call.02.

but a relation compatible with PR1 null PR2 could not be found; ‘=’ indicates that the cell corresponds to a relation

The remaining labels (ARG0, ARG1 and all ARGMs) do generalize in meaning across verbs. Roles
MEXT, MDIS, MADV, MNEG, MMOD, MDIR, are not composable because they encode a very narrow
semantic connection. Manual examination of several examples leads to this conclusion.
Table 4 depicts the primitives for the roles which are composable and their inverses. Note that for
any two relations their primitives are different.
PropBank does not provide domains and ranges for its roles, although we can specify our own. We
do so by using the ontology defined by Helbig (2005). All relations in PropBank are denoted as R(x, y),
where x is an argument of y, and y is a verb. The range of all relations is a situation. The domain of
AGR0 and ARG1 are objects, the domain of MLOC and MTMP local and temporal descriptors respectively,
the domain of MMNR qualities or states, and the domain of MPNC and MCAU are situations.
5.1 Inference
Axioms from PropBank
Out of the four possible axioms between any pair of relations (Table 3), the only way to compose two
relations from PropBank is by using as common argument y a verb. This restriction is due to the fact
that PropBank exclusively annotates relations between a verb and its arguments. Thus, the only possible
axiom for any pair of roles R1 and R2 is R1(x, y) null R2−1(y, z) null R3(x, z), where y is a verb.
Table 5 shows the eight inference axioms obtained after following the steps depicted in Section 4.1.
Note that the matrix is symmetric as stated by the property R1 null R2 = (R2−1 null R1−1)−1.
Some of the axioms obtained are:
null MCAU null MLOC−1 null MLOC−1, the location of a cause is the same than the location of its effect.
null MPNC null ARG0−1 null ARG0−1, the agent of an action is inherited by its purpose.
null MPNC null MMNR−1 null MMNR−1, the manner of an action is inherited by its purpose.
5.2 Evaluation
First, we evaluated all the instantiations of axiom MPNC null MMNR−1 null MMNR−1. This axiom can be
instantiated 237 times using PropBank annotation, yielding 189 new MANNER not present in PropBank.
The overall accuracy is 0.797, superior to state-of-the art semantic role labelers.
Second, we have evaluated the accuracy of the eight inference axioms (Table 5). Since PropBank is
a large corpus, the amount of instantiations found for all axioms is too large to be checked by hand. We
have manually evaluated the first 1,000 sentences that are an instantiation of any axiom. Since a sentence
may instantiate several axioms, we have actually evaluated 1,412 instantiations. The first 1,000 sentences
which are an instantiation of any axiom are found within the first 31,450 sentences in PropBank. Table
6 shows the number of roles PropBank annotates for these sentences.

Table 7: Axioms used during evaluation, number of instances, accuracy and productivity. Results are reported
both using and not using the heuristic. Productivity refers to the number of relations added by the axiom in relative
terms.
Table 7 depicts the total number of instantiations for each axiom and its accuracy (columns 3 and
4). Accuracies range from 0.12 to 0.90, showing that the plausibility of an axiom depends on the axiom.
The average accuracy for axioms involving MCAU is 0.53 and for axioms involving MPNC is 0.54.
Axiom MCAU null ARG0−1 null ARG0−1 adds 201 relations, which corresponds to 0.89% in relative
terms. Its accuracy is low, 0.40. Other axioms are less productive overall, but have a greater relative
impact and accuracy. For example, axiom MPNC null MMNR−1 null MMNR−1, only yields 71 new MMNR,
and yet it is adding 3.21% in relative terms with an accuracy of 0.82.
It is worth noting that overall, applying the eight axioms used during evaluation adds 1,412 relations
on top of the ones already present (2.26% in relative terms) with an accuracy of 0.54.
5.3 Error
Analysis
Because of the low accuracy of axioms 1 and 5, an error analysis was performed. We found that unlike
other axioms, these axioms often yield a relation type that is already present in the semantic representa-
tion. Specifically, axioms 1 and 5 often yield R(x, z) when R(x’, z) is already known.
An example can be found in Figure 4, where axiom 5 yields ARG1(orders, to buy) when the relation
ARG1(the basket, to buy) is already present. We use the following heuristic in order to improve the
accuracy of axioms 1 and 5: do not instantiate an axiom R1(x, y) null R2(y, z) null R3(x, z) if a relation of
the form R3(x’, z) is already known.
This simple heuristic allows us to augment the accuracy of the inferences at the cost of lowering their
productivity. The last three columns in Table 7 show results when using the heuristic. The eight axioms
add 840 relations (1.35% in relative terms) with an accuracy of 0.86.

about ... (wsj 0134, 0).
Figures 2 and 3 instantiate axioms 1, 2 and 3. For these examples, all inferences are correct.
Figures 4 and 5 instantiate the rest of axioms. Not using the heuristic leads to a wrong inference in
the example shown in Figure 4, indicated with *. Using the heuristic, all inferences are correct.
6 Comparison
with Previous Work
There have been abundant proposals to detect semantic relations without taking into account composition
of relations. All these approaches, regardless of their particular details, take as their input text and output
the relations found in it. In contrast, the framework proposed in this article obtains axioms that take as
their input relations found in text and output more relations previously ignored.
Generally, efforts to extract semantic relations have concentrated on particular sets of relations or a
single relation, e.g. CAUSE (Bethard and Martin, 2008; Chang and Choi, 2006) and PART-WHOLE (Girju
et al., 2006). Automatic detection of semantic roles has received a lot of attention lately (M`arquez et al.,
2008; Carreras and M`arquez, 2005). The SemEval-2007 Task 04 (Girju et al., 2007) and SemEval-2010
Task 08 (Hendrickx et al., 2009) aimed at relations between nominals. There has been work on detecting
relations within noun phrases (Moldovan et al., 2004; Nulty, 2007), clauses (Szpakowicz et al., 1995)
and syntax-based comma resolution (Srikumar et al., 2008).
Previous research has exploited the idea of using semantic primitives to define and classify semantic
relations under different names. Among others, the literature uses relation elements, deep structure,
aspects and primitives. To the best of our knowledge, the first effort on describing semantic relations
52
using primitives was made by Chaffin and Herrmann (1987). They introduce Relation Element Theory,
and differentiate relations by relation elements. The authors describe a set of 31 relations clustered in five
groups (CONTRAST, SIMILARS, CLASS INCLUSION, CASE-RELATIONS, PART-WHOLE), and distinguish
each relation by its relations elements and not just a definition and examples. Their 30 relation elements
are clustered into five groups (elements of intensional force, dimension elements, elements of agreement,
propositionalelements, elementsofpart-wholeinclusion). Theyonlyusethe elements todefinerelations,
not to compose relations.
Winston et al. (1987) work with six subtypes of PART-WHOLE and uses 3 relation elements (func-
tional, homeomerous and separable) to distinguish the subtypes. Cohen and Losielle (1988) introduce
the notion of deep structure and characterize it using two aspects: hierarchical and temporal. Huhns and
Stephens (1989) extend previous works by considering an extended set of 10 primitives.
In Computational Linguistics there have been previous proposals to combine semantic relations.
Harabagiu and Moldovan (1998) manually extract plausible inference axioms using WordNet relations.
Helbig (2005) transforms chains of relations into theoretical axioms. On the other hand, the model
presented in this paper extracts inference axioms automatically.
Composing relations has been proposed before in the more general field of Artificial Intelligence,
in particular in the context of Knowledge Bases. Cohen and Losielle (1988) point out that two relations
shall combine if and only if they do not have contradictory values for the aspect hierarchical or temporal.
Theyworkwithasetofninespecificrelations(CAUSES, COMPONENT-OF, FOCUS-OF, MECHANISM-OF,
PRODUCT-OF, PURPOSE-OF, SETTING-OF, SUBJECT-OF and SUBFIELD-OF) and their inverses. Huhns
and Stephens (1989) are the first to propose an algebra for composing semantic primitives. Unlike ours,
their set of relations is not linguistically motivated; ten of them map to some sort of PART-WHOLE (e.g.
PIECE-OF, SUBREGION-OF).
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we have presented a model to compose semantic relations. The model is independent of
any particular set of relations and is able to obtain inference axioms. These axioms take as their input
two semantic relations and yield a previously ignored relation as conclusion.
The model is based on an extended definition of semantic relations, including restrictions on domains
and ranges and values for a set of semantic primitives. We have defined an algebra for composing
semantic primitives. This algebra is the key to automatically identify the resulting relation of composing
a pair of compatible relations and to form an axiom.
The proposed algorithm to compose semantic relations identifies eight inference axioms using Prop-
Bank relations. When instantiated in a subset of PropBank, these axioms add 2.26% of annotation in
relative terms with an accuracy of 0.54. We believe these results are worthwhile for a completely unsu-
pervised approach to obtain semantic relations. Adding a simple heuristic improves the accuracy to 0.86,
lowering the productivity in relative terms to 1.35%.
The model has limitations and is not always correct. First, relations are defined manually and mis-
takes could be made when assigning values to their primitives. Second, the algebra for composing
primitives is also manually defined.
We find the first problem easy to overcome. Whatever the set of relations one might use, we believe
thinking in terms of primitives helps to understand the nature of the relations and their differences. An
issue might be that the proposed set of primitives is not enough for a particular set, but more primitives
could be added to solve this eventuality.
A further issue with the algebra is the fact that primitives are composed orthogonally. This is a
simplification, but we have shown that this simplified algebra works.
Even though different sets of semantic relations may call for different ontologies to define domains
and ranges, and possibly an extended set of primitives, we believe the model presented in this paper is
applicable to any set. As far as we are concerned, this is a novel way to compose semantic relations in
the field of Computational Linguistics.
