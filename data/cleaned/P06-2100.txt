c©2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Morphological Richness Offsets Resource DemandExperiences in Constructing a POS Tagger for Hindi Smriti Singh Kuhoo Gupta Department of Computer Science and Engineering Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay Powai, Mumbai 400076 Maharashtra, India {smriti,kuhoo,manshri,pb}@cse.iitb.ac.in Manish Shrivastava Pushpak Bhattacharyya Abstract In this paper we report our work on building a POS tagger for a morphologically rich languageHindi.
The theme of the research is to vindicate the stand thatif morphology is strong and harnessable, then lack of training corpora is not debilitating.
We establish a methodology of POS tagging which the resource disadvantaged (lacking annotated corpora) languages can make use of.
The methodology makes use of locally annotated modestly-sized corpora (15,562 words), exhaustive morpohological analysis backed by high-coverage lexicon and a decision tree based learning algorithm (CN2).
The evaluation of the system was done with 4-fold cross validation of the corpora in the news domain (www.bbc.co.uk/hindi).
The current accuracy of POS tagging is 93.45% and can be further improved.
1 Motivation
and Problem De nition Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging is a complex task fraught with challenges like ambiguity of parts of speech and handling of lexical absence (proper nouns, foreign words, derivationally morphed words, spelling variations and other unknown words) (Manning and Schutze, 2002).
For English there are many POS taggers, employing machine learning techniques like transformation-based error-driven learning (Brill, 1995), decision trees (Black et al., 1992), markov model (Cutting et al.1992), maximum entropy methods (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) etc.
There are also taggers which are hybrid using both stochastic and rule-based approaches, such as CLAWS (Garside and Smith, 1997).
The accuracy of these taggers ranges from 93-98% approximately.
English has annotated corpora in abundance, enabling usage of powerful data driven machine learning methods.
But, very few languages in the world have the resource advantage that English enjoys.
In this scenario, POS tagging of highly inectional languages presents an interesting case study.
Morphologically rich languages are characterized by a large number of morphemes in a single word, where morpheme boundaries are dif cult to detect because they are fused together.
They are typically free-word ordered, which causes xed-context systems to be hardly adequate for statistical approaches (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997).
Morphology-based POS tagging of some languages like Turkish (O azer and Kuruoz, 1994), Arabic (Guiassa, 2006), Czech (Hajic et al., 2001), Modern Greek (Orphanos et al., 1999) and Hungarian (Megyesi, 1999) has been tried out using a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistical learning.
These systems use large amount of corpora along with morphological analysis to POS tag the texts.
It may be noted that a purely rule-based or a purely stochastic approach will not be effective for such 779 languages, since the former demands subtle linguistic expertise and the latter variously permuted corpora.
1.1 Previous
Work on Hindi POS Tagging There is some amount of work done on morphology-based disambiguation in Hindi POS tagging.
Bharati et al.(1995) in their work on computational Paninian parser, describe a technique where POS tagging is implicit and is merged with the parsing phase.
Ray et al.(2003) proposed an algorithm that identi es Hindi word groups on the basis of the lexical tags of the individual words.
Their partial POS tagger (as they call it) reduces the number of possible tags for a given sentence by imposing some constraints on the sequence of lexical categories that are possible in a Hindi sentence.
UPENN also has an online Hindi morphological tagger1 but there exists no literature discussing the performance of the tagger.
1.2 Our
Approach We present in this paper a POS tagger for Hindithe national language of India, spoken by 500 million people and ranking 4th in the world.
We establish a methodology of POS tagging which the resource disadvantaged (lacking annotated corpora) languages can make use of.
This methodology uses locally annotated modestly sized corpora (15,562 words), exhaustive morphological analysis backed by highcoverage lexicon and a decision tree based learning algorithmCN2 (Clark and Niblett, 1989).
To the best of our knowledge, such an approach has never been tried out for Hindi.
The heart of the system is the detailed linguistic analysis of morphosyntactic phenomena, adroit handling of suf xes, accurate verb group identi cation and learning of disambiguation rules.
The approach can be used for other in ectional languages by providing the language speci c resources in the form of suf x replacement rules (SRRs), lexicon, group identi cation and morpheme analysis rules etc.
and keeping the 1http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/plc/tamilweb/hindi.html processes the same as shown in Figure 1.
The similar kind of work exploiting morphological information to assign POS tags is under progress for Marathi which is also an Indian language.
In what follows, we discuss in section 2 the challenges in Hindi POS tagging followed by a section on morphological structure of Hindi.
Section 4 presents the design of Hindi POS tagger.
The experimental setup and results are given in sections 5 and 6.
Section 7 concludes the paper.
2 Challenges
of POS Tagging in Hindi The inter-POS ambiguity surfaces when a word or a morpheme displays an ambiguity across POS categories.
Such a word has multiple entries in the lexicon (one for each category).
After stemming, the word would be assigned all possible POS tags based on the number of entries it has in the lexicon.
The complexity of the task can be understood looking at the following English sentence where the word ‘back’ falls into three different POS categoriesI get back to the back seat to give rest to my back.
The complexity further increases when it comes to tagging a free-word order language like Hindi where almost all the permutations of words in a clause are possible (Shrivastava et al., 2005).
This phenomenon in the language, makes the task of a stochastic tagger dif cult.
Intra-POS ambiguity arises when a word has one POS with different feature values, e.g., the word ‘a0a2a1a4a3a5 ’ {laDke} (boys/boy) in Hindi is a noun but can be analyzed in two ways in terms of its feature values: 1.
POS: Noun, Number: Sg, Case: Oblique a6a7a9a8a11a10a5a12a0a2a1a13a3a5a14a3a16a15a14a17a4a3a19a18a21a20a22a6a24a23a26a25a28a27a29a20. maine laDke ko ek aam diyaa.
I-erg boy to one mango gave.
I gave a mango to the boy.
2. POS: Noun, Number: Pl, Case: Direct a0a30a1a4a3a5a31a18a21a20a22a6a33a32a2a20a22a34a5a12a35a7a36a8 . laDke aam khaate hain.
Boys mangoes eat.
Boys eat mangoes.
780 One of the dif cult tasks here is to choose the appropriate tag based on the morphology of the word and the context used.
Also, new words appear all the time in the texts.
Thus, a method for determining the tag of a new word is needed when it is not present in the lexicon.
This is done using context information and the information coded in the af xes, as af xes in Hindi (especially in nouns and verbs) are strong indicators of a word’s POS category.
For example, it is possible to determine that the word ‘a37 a20a22a17a4a38a39a20 ’ {jaaegaa} (will go) is a verb, based on the environment in which it appears and the knowledge that it carries the in ectional suf x -a17a4a38a39a20 {egaa} that attaches to the base verb ‘a37 a20 ’ {jaa}.
2.1 Ambiguity
Schemes The criterion to decide whether the tag of a word is a Noun or a Verb is entirely different from that of whether a word is an Adjective or an Adverb.
For example, the word ‘a40a42a41 ’ can occur as conjunction, post-position or a noun (as shown previously), hence it falls in an Ambiguity Scheme ‘Conjunction-Noun-Postposition’.
We grouped all the ambiguous words into sets according to the Ambiguity Schemes that are possible in Hindi, e.g., Adjective-Noun, Adjective-Adverb, NounVerb, etc.
This idea was rst proposed by Orphanos et al.(1999) for Modern Greek POS tagging.
3 Morphological
Structure Of Hindi In Hindi, Nouns in ect for number and case.
To capture their morphological variations, they can be categorized into various paradigms2 (Narayana, 1994) based on their vowel ending, gender, number and case information.
We have a list of around 29,000 Hindi nouns that are categorized into such paradigms3.
Looking at the morphological patterns of the words in a paradigm, suf x-replacement rules have been developed.
These rules help in separating out a valid suf x 2A paradigm systematically arranges and identi es the unin ected forms of the words that share similar in ectional patterns.
3Anusaaraka system developed at IIT Kanpur (INDIA) uses similar noun sets in the form of paradigms from an in ected word to output the correct stem and consequently, get the correct root.
Hindi Adjectives may be in ected or uninected, e.g., ‘a43 a6a29a3a45a44a46a0a30a20 ’ {chamkiilaa} (shiny), ‘a18a21a47a49a48a50a20 ’ {acchaa} (nice), ‘a0a51a8a53a52a42a20 ’ {lambaa} (long) in ect based on the number and case values of their head nouns while ‘a54a55 a8a56a25 a41 ’ {sundar} (beautiful), ‘a57 a20 a41 a44 ’ {bhaarii} (heavy) etc.
do not in ect.
Hindi Verbs in ect for the following grammatical properties (GNPTAM): 1.
Gender: Masculine, Feminine, Nonspeci c 2.
Number: Singular, Plural, Non-speci c 3.
Person: 1st, 2nd and 3rd 4.
Tense: Past, Present, Future 5.
Aspect: Perfective, Completive, Frequentative, Habitual, Durative, Inceptive, Stative 6.
Modality: Imperative, Probabilitive, Subjunctive, Conditional, Deontic, Abilitive, Permissive The morphemes attached to a verb along with their corresponding analyses help identify values for GNPTAM features for a given verb form.
Division of Information Load in Hindi Verb Groups A Verb Group (VG) primarily comprises main verb and auxiliaries.
Constituents like particles, negation markers, conjunction, etc.
can also occur within a VG.
It is important to know how much of GNPTAM feature information is stored in VG constituents individually and what is the load division in the absence or presence of auxiliaries.
In a Hindi VG, when there is no auxiliary present, the complete information load falls on the main verb which carries information for GNPTAM features.
In presence of auxiliaries, the load gets shared between the main verb and auxiliaries, and is represented in the form of different morphemes (in ected or unin ected), e.g., in the sentence 781 a6a7a9a8a29a52a26a15a42a0 a40 a20 a41 a35a58a20a59a35a60a61 main bol paa rahaa hoon I am able to speak 1.
Main verb ‘a52a22a15a42a0 ’ {bol} is unin ected and does not carry any information for any of the GNPTAM features.
2. ‘a40 a20 ’ {paa} is unin ected and gives modality information, i.e., Abilitive.
3. ‘a41 a35a58a20 ’ {rahaa} gives Number (Sg), Gender (Masculine), Aspect (Durative) 4.
‘a35a60a61 ’ {hoon} gives Number (Sg), Person (1st), Tense (Present) Gerund Identi cation In Hindi, the attachment of verbal suf xes like ‘a10a4a20 ’ {naa} and ‘a10a5 ’ {ne} to a verb root results either in a gerund like ‘a34a7 a41 a10a13a20 ’ {tairnaa} (swimming) or in an in nitival verb form like ‘a34a7 a41 a10a4a20 ’ {tairnaa} (to swim).
We observed that it is easy to detect a gerund if it is followed by a casemarker or by any other in nitival verb form.
4 Design
of Hindi POS Tagger 4.1 Morphology Driven Tagger Morphology driven tagger makes use of the af x information stored in a word and assigns a POS tag using no contextual information.
Though, it does take into account the previous and the next word in a VG to correctly identify the main verb and the auxiliaries, other POS categories are identi ed through lexicon lookup of the root form.
The current lexicon4 has around 42,000 entries belonging to the major categories as mentioned in Figure 3.
The format of each entry is 〈word〉,〈paradigm〉,〈category〉.
The process does not involve learning or disambiguation of any sort and is completely driven by hand-crafted morphology rules.
The architecture of the tagger is shown in Figure 1.
The work progresses at two levels: 4The lexicon was developed using the wordlist from Hindi Wordnet (http://www.c lt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/) and partial noun list from Anusaraka.
It is being enhanced by adding new words from the corpus and removing the inconsistencies.
1. At Word Level: A stemmer is used in conjunction with lexicon and Suf x Replacement Rules (SRRs) to output all possible root-suf x pairs along with POS category label for a word.
There is a possibility that the input word is not found in the lexicon and does not carry any in ectional suf x.
In such a case, derivational morphology rules are applied.
2. At Group Level: At this level a Morphological Analyzer (MA) uses the information encoded in the extracted suf x to add morphological information to the word.
For nouns, the information provided by the sufxes is restricted only to ‘Number’.
‘Case’ can be inferred later by looking at the neighbouring words.
For verbs, GNP values are found at the word level, while TAM values are identi ed during the VG Identi cation phase, described later.
The analysis of the suf x is done in a discrete manner, i.e., each component of the suf x is analyzed separately.
A morpheme analysis table comprising individual morphemes with their paradigm information and analyses is used for this purpose.
MA’s output for the word a32a62a20a22a63a28a8a56a38a64a44 {khaaoongii} (will eat) looks like Stem: a32a2a20 (eat) Suf x: a63a28a8a53a38a26a44 Category: Verb Morpheme 1: a63a28a8 Analysis: 1 Per, Sg Morpheme 2: a38 Analysis: Future Morpheme 3: a65 Analysis: Feminine 4.1.1 Verb Group Identi cation The structure of a Hindi VG is relatively rigid and can be captured well using simple syntactic rules.
In Hindi, certain auxiliaries like ’a41 a35 ’ {rah}, ’a40 a20 ’ {paa}, ’a54 a3 ’, {sak} or ’a40 a1 ’ {paD} can also occur as main verbs in some contexts.
VG identi cation deals with identifying the main verb and the auxiliaries of a VG while discounting for particles, conjunctions and negation markers.
The VG identi cation goes left to right by marking the rst constituent as the main verb or copula verb and making every other verb con782 Figure 1: Overall Architecture of the Tagger Table 1: Average Accuracy(%) Comparison of Various Approaches LLB LLBD MD BL LB 61.19 86.77 73.62 82.63 93.45 struct an auxiliary till a non-VG constituent is encountered.
Main verb and copula verb can take the head position of a VG and can occur with or without auxiliary verbs.
Auxiliary verbs, on the other hand, always come along with a main verb or a copula verb.
This results in a very high accuracy of 99.5% for verb auxiliaries.
Ambiguity between a main verb and a copula verb remains unresolved at this level and asks for disambiguation rules.
4.2 Need
for Disambiguation The accuracy obtained by simple lexicon lookup based approach (LLB) comes out to be 61.19%.
The morphology-driven tagger, on the other hand, performs better than just lexicon lookup but still results in considerable ambiguity.
These results are signi cant as they present a strong case in favor of using detailed morphological analysis.
Similar observation has been presented by Uchimoto et al.(2001) for Japanese language.
According to the tagging performed by SRRs and the lexicon, a word receives n tags if it belongs to n POSs.
If we consider multiple tags for a word as an error of the tagger (even when the options contain the correct tag for a word), then the accuracy of the tagger comes to be 73.62% (as shown in Table 1).
The goal is to keep the contextually appropriate tag and eliminate others which can be achieved by devising a disambiguation technique.
The disambiguation task can be naively addressed by choosing the most frequent tag for a word.
This approach is also known as baseline (BL) tagging.
The baseline accuracy turns out to be 82.63% which is still higher than that of the morphology-driven tagger5.
The drawback with baseline tagging is that its accuracy cannot be further improved.
On the other hand, there is enough room for improving upon the accuracy of morphology-driven (MD) tagger.
It is quite evident that though the MD tagger works well for VG and many close categories, around 30% of the words are either ambiguous or unknown.
Hence, a disambiguation stage is needed to shoot up the accuracy.
The common choice for disambiguation rule learning in POS tagging task is usually machine learning techniques mainly focussing on decision tree based algorithms (Orphanos and Christodoulalds, 1999), neural networks (Schmid, 1994), etc.
Among the various decision tree based algorithms like ID3, AQR, ASSISTANT and CN2, CN2 is known to perform better than the rest (Clark and Niblett, 1989).
Since no such machine learning technique has been used for Hindi language, we thought of choosing CN2 as it performs well on noisy data6.
5These numbers may change if we experiment on a different dataset 6The training annotated corpora becomes noisy by virtue of intuitions of different annotators (trained native Hindi speakers) 783 4.2.1 Training Corpora We set up a corpus, collecting sentences from BBC news site7 and let the morphology-driven tagger assign morphosyntactic tags to all the words.
For an ambiguous word, the contextually appropriate POS tag is manually chosen.
Unknown words are assigned a correct tag based on their context and usage.
4.2.2 Learning
Out of the completely manually corrected corpora of 15,562 tokens, we created training instances for each Ambiguity Scheme and for Unknown words.
These training instances take into account the POS categories of the neighbouring words and not the feature values8.
The experiments were carried out for different context window sizes ranging from 2 to 20 to nd the best con guration.
4.2.3 Rule
Generation The rules are generated from the training corpora by extracting the ambiguity scheme (AS) of each word.
If the word is not present in the lexicon then its AS is set as ‘unknown’.
Once the AS is identi ed, a training instance is formed.
This training instance contains the neighbouring correct POS categories as attributes.
The number of neighbours included in the training instance is the window size for CN2.
After all the ambiguous words are processed and training instances for all seen ASs are created, the CN2 algorithm is applied over the training instances to generate actual rule-sets for each AS.
The CN2 algorithm gives one set of If-Then rules (either ordered or unordered) for each AS including ‘unknown’9.
The AS of every ambiguous word is formed while tagging.
A corresponding rule-set for that AS is then identi ed and traversed to get the contextually appropriate rule.
The resultant 7http://www.bbc.co.uk/hindi/ 8Considering that a tag encodes 0 to 6 morphosyntactic features and each feature takes either one or a disjunction of 2 to 7 values, the total number of different tags can count up to several hundreds 9We used the CN2 algorithm implementation (1990) by Robin Boswell.
The software is available at ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/pclark/cn2.tar.Z category outputted by this rule is then assigned to the ambiguous word.
The traversal rule differs for ordered and unordered implementation.
The POS of an unknown word is guessed by traversing the rule-set for unknown words10 and assigning it the resultant tag.
5 Experimental
Setup The experimentation involved, rst, identifying the best parameter values for the CN2 algorithm and second, evaluating the performance of the disambiguation rules generated by CN2 for the POS tagging task.
5.1 CN2
Parameters The various parameters in CN2 algorithm are: rule type (ordered or unordered), star size, signi cance threshold and size of the training instances (window size).
The best results are empirically achieved with ordered rules, star size as 1, signi cance threshold as 10 and window size 4, i.e., two neighbours on either side are used to generate the training instances.
5.2 Evaluation
The tests are performed on contiguous partitions of the corpora (15,562 words) that are 75% training set and 25% testing set.
Accuracy = no.

of tokens The results are obtained by performing a 4fold cross validation over the corpora.
Figure 2 gives the learning curve of the disambiguation module for varying corpora sizes starting from 1000 to the complete training corpora size.
The accuracy for known and unknown words is also measured separately.
6 Results
and Discussion The average accuracy of the learning based (LB) tagger after 4-fold cross validation is 93.45%.
To 10Most of the unknown words are proper nouns, which cannot be stored in the lexicon extensively.
So, it also helps in named-entity detection.

From Table 1, we can see that the disambiguation module brings up the accuracy of simple lexicon lookup based approach by around 25% (LLBD).
The overall average accuracy is also brought up by around 20% by augmenting the morphology-driven (MD) tagger by a disambiguation module; hence justifying our belief that a disambiguation module over a morphology driven approach yields better results.
One interesting observation is the performance of the tagger on individual POS categories.
Figure 3 shows clearly that the per POS accuracies of the LB tagger highly exceeds those of the MD and BL tagger for most categories.
This means that the disambiguation module correctly disambiguates and correctly identi es the unknown words too.
The accuracy on unknown words, as earlier shown in Figure 2, is very high at 92.08%.
The percentage of unknown words in the test corpora is 0.013.
It seems independent of the size of training corpus because the corpora is unbalanced having most of the unknowns as proper nouns.
The rules are formed on this bias, and hence the application of these rules assigns PPN tag to an unknown which is mostly the case.
From Figure 3 again we see that the accuracy on some categories remains very low even after disambiguation.
This calls for some detailed failure analysis.
By looking at the categories having low accuracy, such as pronoun, intensi er, demonstratives and verb copula, we nd that all of them are highly ambiguous and, almost invariably, very rare in the corpus.
Also, most of them are hard to disambiguate without any semantic information.
7 Conclusions
& Future Work We have described in this paper a POS tagger for Hindi which can overcome the handicap of annotated corpora scarcity by exploiting the rich morphology of the language and the relatively rigid word-order within a VG.
The whole work was driven by hunting down the factors that lower the accuracy of Verbs and weeding them out.
A detailed study of accuracy distribution across the POS tags pointed out the cases calling for elaborate disambiguation rules.
A major strength of the work is the learning of disambiguation rules, which otherwise would have been hand-coded, thus demanding exhaustive analysis of language phenomena.
Attaining an accuracy of close to 94%, from a corpora of just about 15,562 words lends credence to the belief that morphological richness can offset resource scarcity . The work could lead such efforts of POS tag building for all those languages which have rich morphology, but cannot afford to invest a lot in creating large annotated corpora.
Several interesting future directions suggest themselves.
It will be worthwhile to investigate a statistical approach like Conditional Random Fields in which the feature functions would be constructed from morphology.
The next logical step from the POS tagger is a chunker for Hindi.
In fact a start on this has already been made through VG identi cation.
