c©2006 Association for Computational Linguistics A Feedback-Augmented Method for Detecting Errors in the Writing of Learners of English Ryo Nagata Hyogo University of Teacher Education 6731494, Japan rnagata@hyogo-u.ac.jp Atsuo Kawai Mie University 5148507, Japan kawai@ai.info.mie-u.ac.jp Koichiro Morihiro Hyogo University of Teacher Education 6731494, Japan mori@hyogo-u.ac.jp Naoki Isu Mie University 5148507, Japan isu@ai.info.mie-u.ac.jp Abstract This paper proposes a method for detecting errors in article usage and singular plural usage based on the mass count distinction.
First, it learns decision lists from training data generated automatically to distinguish mass and count nouns.
Then, in order to improve its performance, it is augmented by feedback that is obtained from the writing of learners.
Finally, it detects errors by applying rules to the mass count distinction.
Experiments show that it achieves a recall of 0.71 and a precision of 0.72 and outperforms other methods used for comparison when augmented by feedback.
1 Introduction
Although several researchers (Kawai et al., 1984; McCoy et al., 1996; Schneider and McCoy, 1998; Tschichold et al., 1997) have shown that rulebased methods are effective to detecting grammatical errors in the writing of learners of English, it has been pointed out that it is hard to write rules for detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage.
To be precise, it is hard to write rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns which are particularly important in detecting these errors (Kawai et al., 1984).
The major reason for this is that whether a noun is a mass noun or a count noun greatly depends on its meaning or its surrounding context (refer to Allan (1980) and Bond (2005) for details of the mass count distinction).
The above errors are very common among Japanese learners of English (Kawai et al., 1984; Izumi et al., 2003).
This is perhaps because the Japanese language does not have a mass count distinction system similar to that of English.
Thus, it is favorable for error detection systems aiming at Japanese learners to be capable of detecting these errors.
In other words, such systems need to somehow distinguish mass and count nouns.
This paper proposes a method for distinguishing mass and count nouns in context to complement the conventional rules for detecting grammatical errors.
In this method, rst, training data, which consist of instances of mass and count nouns, are automatically generated from a corpus.
Then, decision lists for distinguishing mass and count nouns are learned from the training data.
Finally, the decision lists are used with the conventional rules to detect the target errors.
The proposed method requires a corpus to learn decision lists for distinguishing mass and count nouns.
General corpora such as newspaper articles can be used for the purpose.
However, a drawback to it is that there are differences in character between general corpora and the writing of non-native learners of English (Granger, 1998; Chodorow and Leacock, 2000).
For instance, Chodorow and Leacock (2000) point out that the word concentrate is usually used as a noun in a general corpus whereas it is a verb 91% of the time in essays written by non-native learners of English.
Consequently, the differences affect the performance of the proposed method.
In order to reduce the drawback, the proposed method is augmented by feedback; it takes as feedback learners’ essays whose errors are corrected by a teacher of English (hereafter, referred to as the feedback corpus).
In essence, the feedback corpus could be added to a general corpus to generate training data.
Or, ideally training data could be generated only from the feedback corpus just as 241 from a general corpus.
However, this causes a serious problem in practice since the size of the feedback corpus is normally far smaller than that of a general corpus.
To make it practical, this paper discusses the problem and explores its solution.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows.
Section 2 describes the method for detecting the target errors based on the mass count distinction.
Section 3 explains how the method is augmented by feedback.
Section 4 discusses experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed method.
2 Method
for detecting the target errors 2.1 Generating training data First, instances of the target noun that head their noun phrase (NP) are collected from a corpus with their surrounding words.
This can be simply done by an existing chunker or parser.
Then, the collected instances are tagged with mass or count by the following tagging rules.
For example, the underlined chicken:...
are a lot of chickens in the roost ...
is tagged as ...
are a lot of chickens/count in the roost ...
because it is in plural form.
We have made tagging rules based on linguistic knowledge (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002).
Figure 1 and Table 1 represent the tagging rules.
Figure 1 shows the framework of the tagging rules.
Each node in Figure 1 represents a question applied to the instance in question.
For example, the root node reads Is the instance in question plural?
. Each leaf represents a result of the classication.
For example, if the answer is yes at the root node, the instance in question is tagged with count.
Otherwise, the question at the lower node is applied and so on.
The tagging rules do not classify instances as mass or count in some cases.
These unclassi ed instances are tagged with the symbol ? . Unfortunately, they cannot readily be included in training data.
For simplicity of implementation, they are excluded from training data1.
Note that the tagging rules can be used only for generating training data.
They cannot be used to distinguish mass and count nouns in the writing of learners of English for the purpose of detecting 1According to experiments we have conducted, approximately 30% of instances are tagged with ? on average.
It is highly possible that performance of the proposed method will improve if these instances are included in the training data.
the target errors since they are based on the articles and the distinction between singular and plural.
Finally, the tagged instances are stored in a le with their surrounding words.
Each line of it consists of one of the tagged instances and its surrounding words as in the above chicken example.
2.2 Learning
Decision Lists In the proposed method, decision lists are used for distinguishing mass and count nouns.
One of the reasons for the use of decision lists is that they have been shown to be effective to the word sense disambiguation task and the mass count distinction is highly related to word sense as we will see in this section.
Another reason is that rules for distinguishing mass and count nouns are observable in decision lists, which helps understand and improve the proposed method.
A decision list consists of a set of rules.
Each rule matches the template as follows: If a condition is true, then a decisiona0 (1) To de ne the template in the proposed method, let us have a look at the following two examples: 1.
I read the paper.
2. The paper is made of hemp pulp.
The underlined papers in both sentences cannot simply be classi ed as mass or count by the tagging rules presented in Section 2.1 because both are singular and modi ed by the de nite article.
Nevertheless, we can tell that the former is a count noun and the latter is a mass noun from the contexts.
This suggests that the mass count distinction is often determined by words surrounding the target noun.
In example 1, we can tell that the paper refers to something that can be read such as a newspaper or a scienti c paper from read, and therefore it is a count noun.
Likewise, in example 2, we can tell that the paper refers to a certain substance from made and pulp, and therefore it is a mass noun.
Taking this observation into account, we de ne the template based on words surrounding the target noun.
To formalize the template, we will use a random variable a1a3a2 that takes either a4a6a5a8a7a9a7 or a10a12a11a9a13a15a14a17a16 to denote that the target noun is a mass noun or a count noun, respectively.
We will also use a18 and a2 to denote a word and a certain context around the target noun, respectively.
We de ne 242 a19 a19 a19 a19 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a20 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 yes yes yes yes no no no no a19 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a21 a20 a20 a20 yes no COUNT modi ed by a little?
? COUNT MASS ? MASS plural? modi ed by one of the words in Table 1(a)? modi ed by one of the words in Table 1(b)? modi ed by one of the words in Table 1(c)?
Figure 1: Framework of the tagging rules Table 1: Words used in the tagging rules (a) (b) (c) the inde nite article much the de nite article another less demonstrative adjectives one enough possessive adjectives each suf cient interrogative adjectives quanti ers ’s genitives three types of a2 : a14a8a22, a23a25a24, and a26a27a24 that denote the contexts consisting of the noun phrase that the target noun heads, a24 words to the left of the noun phrase, and a24 words to its right, respectively.
Then the template is formalized by: If word a18 appears in context a2 of the target noun, then it is distinguished as a1a3a2 a0 Hereafter, to keep the notation simple, it will be abbreviated to a18a29a28a31a30 a1a3a2 a0 (2) Now rules that match the template can be obtained from the training data.
All we need to do is to collect words in a2 from the training data.
Here, the words in Table 1 are excluded.
Also, function words (except prepositions), cardinal and quasi-cardinal numerals, and the target noun are excluded.
All words are reduced to their morphological stem and converted entirely to lower case when collected.
For example, the following tagged instance: She ate fried chicken/mass for dinner.
would give a set of rules that match the template: a32 a5 a16a34a33a15a35a29a30 a4a6a5a8a7a9a7 a36a38a37a40a39a42a41a44a43 a30 a4a6a5a8a7a9a7 a36 a11 a37a46a45 a35 a30 a4a6a5a8a7a46a7 a47a49a48 a14a17a14a50a32 a37a46a45 a35 a30 a4a6a5a8a7a9a7 for the target noun chicken when a24a52a51a54a53 . In addition, a default rule is de ned.
It is based on the target noun itself and used when no other applicable rules are found in the decision list for the target noun.
It is de ned by a16a55a30 a1a56a2 major (3) where a16 and a1a3a2 major denote the target noun and the majority of a1a56a2 in the training data, respectively.
Equation (3) reads If the target noun appears, then it is distinguished by the majority . The log-likelihood ratio (Yarowsky, 1995) decides in which order rules are applied to the target noun in novel context.
It is de ned by2 a57 a11a46a58 a22a60a59 a1a56a2a62a61 a18 a28a60a63 a22a60a59 a1a56a2a62a61 a18 a28a60a63 (4) where a1a56a2 is the exclusive event of a1a3a2 and a22a64a59 a1a3a2a65a61 a18 a28a55a63 is the probability that the target noun is used as a1a56a2 when a18 appears in the context a2 . It is important to exercise some care in estimating a22a64a59 a1a56a2a62a61a18a29a28 a63 . In principle, we could simply 2For the default rule, the log-likelihood ratio is de ned by replacing a66a50a67 and a68a70a69 with a71 and a68a70a69 major, respectively.
243 count the number of times that a18 appears in the context a2 of the target noun used as a1a3a2 in the training data.
However, this estimate can be unreliable, when a18 does not appear often in the context.
To solve this problem, using a smoothing parameter a72 (Yarowsky, 1996), a22a60a59 a1a56a2a62a61a18 a28a55a63 is estimated by3 a22a60a59 a1a56a2a62a61 a18 a28a60a63 a51 a36 a59a73a18a29a28a75a74 a1a3a2 a63 a26a76a72 a36 a59a73a18 a28a60a63 a26a77a4a70a72 (5) where a36 a59a73a18 a28a55a63 and a36 a59a73a18 a28 a74 a1a3a2 a63 are occurrences of a18 appearing in a2 and those in a2 of the target noun used as a1a56a2, respectively.
The constant a4 is the number of possible classes, that is, a4a78a51a3a79 (a4a6a5a80a7a9a7 or a10a12a11a9a13a15a14a17a16 ) in our case, and introduced to satisfy a22a64a59 a1a3a2a65a61 a18 a28a55a63 a26 a22a64a59 a1a3a2a65a61 a18 a28a81a63 a51a3a82 . In this paper, a72 is set to 1.
Rules in a decision list are sorted in descending order by the log-likelihood ratio.
They are tested on the target noun in novel context in this order.
Rules sorted below the default rule are discarded4 because they are never used as we will see in Section 2.3.
Table 2 shows part of a decision list for the target noun chicken that was learned from a subset of the BNC (British National Corpus) (Burnard, 1995).
Note that the rules are divided into two columns for the purpose of illustration in Table 2; in practice, they are merged into one.
Table 2: Rules in a decision list Mass Count a18 a28 LLR a18 a28 LLR a22 a48 a32a83a10a84a32 a33a15a35 1.49 a10a12a11a9a13a15a14a17a16 a33a15a35 1.49 a36 a48 a7a46a85 a33a15a35 1.28 a22a38a32a86a10 a24 a45 a35 1.32 a47a49a48 a7a9a85 a33a15a35 1.23 a22 a48 a58 a41a12a43 1.23 a7a46a24 a48 a14 a45 a35 1.23 a37 a13a15a14 a33a15a35 1.23 a7 a32 a37a9a87 a32 a45 a35 1.18 a32a12a58a88a58 a41a44a43 1.18 target noun: chicken, a24a52a51a89a53 LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) On one hand, we associate the words in the left half with food or cooking.
On the other hand, we associate those in the right half with animals or birds.
From this observation, we can say that chicken in the sense of an animal or a bird is a count noun but a mass noun when referring to food 3The probability for the default rule is estimated just as the log-likelihood ratio for the default rule above.
4It depends on the target noun how many rules are discarded.
or cooking, which agrees with the knowledge presented in previous work (Ostler and Atkins, 1991).
2.3 Distinguishing
mass and count nouns To distinguish the target noun in novel context, each rule in the decision list is tested on it in the sorted order until the rst applicable one is found.
It is distinguished according to the rst applicable one.
Ties are broken by the rules below.
It should be noted that rules sorted below the default rule are never used because the default rule is always applicable to the target noun.
This is the reason why rules sorted below the default rule are discarded as mentioned in Section 2.2. 2.4 Detecting the target errors The target errors are detected by the following three steps.
Rules in each step are examined on each target noun in the target text.
In the rst step, any mass noun in plural form is detected as an error5.
If an error is detected in this step, the rest of the steps are not applied.
In the second step, errors are detected by the rules described in Table 3.
The symbol a90 in Table 3 denotes that the combination of the corresponding row and column is erroneous.
For example, the fth row denotes that singular and plural count nouns modi ed by much are erroneous.
The symbol denotes that no error can be detected by the table.
If one of the rules in Table 3 is applied to the target noun, the third step is not applied.
In the third step, errors are detected by the rules described in Table 4.
The symbols a90 and are the same as in Table 3.
In addition, the inde nite article that modi es other than the head noun is judged to be erroneous Table 3: Detection rules (i) Count Mass Pattern Sing.
Pl. Sing.
a91 another, each, one a92 a90 a90 a91 all, enough, suf cient a92 a90 a91 much a92 a90 a90 a91 that, this a92 a90 a91 few, many, several a92 a90 a90 a91 these, those a92 a90 a90 a91 various, numerous a92 a90 a90 cardinal numbers exc.

However, they are rare especially in the writing of learners of English.
244 Table 4: Detection rules (ii) Singular Plural a/an the a93 a/an the a93 Mass a90 a90 a90 a90 Count a90 a90 (e.g., *an expensive).
Likewise, the de nite article that modi es other than the head noun or adjective is judged to be erroneous (e.g., *the them).
Also, we have made exceptions to the rules.
The following combinations are excluded from the detection in the second and third steps: head nouns modi ed by interrogative adjectives (e.g., what), possessive adjectives (e.g., my), ’s genitives, some, any, or no . 3 Feedback-augmented method As mentioned in Section 1, the proposed method takes the feedback corpus6 as feedback to improve its performance.
In essence, decision lists could be learned from a corpus consisting of a general corpus and the feedback corpus.
However, since the size of the feedback corpus is normally far smaller than that of general corpora, so is the effect of the feedback corpus on a22a64a59 a1a3a2a65a61a18a94a28 a63 . This means that the feedback corpus hardly has effect on the performance.
Instead, a22a64a59 a1a3a2a65a61a18 a28a55a63 can be estimated by interpolating the probabilities estimated from the feedback corpus and the general corpus according to con dences of their estimates.
It is favorable that the interpolated probability approaches to the probability estimated from the feedback corpus as its con dence increases; the more con dent its estimate is, the more effect it has on the interpolated probability.
Here, con dence a10 of ratio a22 is measured by the reciprocal of variance of the ratio (Tanaka, 1977).
Variance is calculated by a22a64a59 a82a95a23 a22 a63 a14 (6) where a14 denotes the number of samples used for calculating the ratio.
Therefore, con dence of the estimate of the conditional probability used in the proposed method is measured by a10 a51 a36 a59a73a18a29a28 a63 a22a64a59 a1a56a2a62a61 a18 a28a55a63 a59 a82a95a23 a22a64a59 a1a3a2a65a61 a18 a28a81a63a96a63 a0 (7) 6The feedback corpus refers to learners’ essays whose errors are corrected as mentioned in Section 1.
To formalize the interpolated probability, we will use the symbols a22a17a97a83a98, a22a100a99, a10a84a97a83a98, and a10a12a99 to denote the conditional probabilities estimated from the feedback corpus and the general corpus, and their con dences, respectively.
Then, the interpolated probability a22a38a101 is estimated by7 a22a15a101 a51 a102 a22a15a99 a26a3a103a105a104a107a106 a103a109a108 a59a110a22a38a97a84a98 a23 a22a15a99 a63 a74 a10a84a97a84a98a95a111a112a10a113a99 a22a38a97a83a98a113a74 a10a84a97a84a98a95a114a112a10 a99 a0 (8) In Equation (8), the effect of a22a115a97a84a98 on a22a15a101 becomes large as its con dence increases.
It should also be noted that when its con dence exceeds that of a22 a99, the general corpus is no longer used in the interpolated probability.
A problem that arises in Equation (8) is thata22a50a97a84a98 hardly has effect ona22a38a101 when a much larger general corpus is used than the feedback corpus even ifa22a116a97a84a98 is estimated with a suf cient con dence.
For example,a22a38a97a83a98 estimated from 100 samples, which are a relatively large number for estimating a probability, hardly has effect on a22a117a101 whena22 a99 is estimated from 10000 samples; roughly, a22a115a97a83a98 has a a82a86a118a80a82a84a119a42a119 effect of a22 a99 on a22a15a101 . One way to prevent this is to limit the effect of a10 a99 to some extent.
It can be realized by taking the log of a10a44a99 in Equation (8).
That is, the interpolated probability is estimated by a22a15a101 a51 a102 a22 a99 a26a120a103a105a104a96a106 a121a123a122a96a124 a103 a108 a59a110a22a38a97a84a98 a23 a22 a99a46a63 a74a125a10a84a97a84a98a126a111a52a127a129a128a42a130a25a10 a99 a22a38a97a83a98a113a74a125a10a84a97a84a98a126a114a52a127a129a128a42a130a25a10a113a99 a0 (9) It is arguable what base of the log should be used.
In this paper, it is set to 2 so that the effect ofa22 a99 on the interpolated probability becomes large when the con dence of the estimate of the conditional probability estimated from the feedback corpus is small (that is, when there is little data in the feedback corpus for the estimate)8.
In summary, Equation (9) interpolates between the conditional probabilities estimated from the feedback corpus and the general corpus in the feedback-augmented method.
The interpolated probability is then used to calculate the loglikelihood ratio.
Doing so, the proposed method takes the feedback corpus as feedback to improve its performance.
7In general, the interpolated probability needs to be normalized to satisfy a131a133a132a42a134a115a135a137a136 . In our case, however, it is always satis ed without normalization since a132 a104a96a106a139a138 a68a70a69a141a140a66 a67a15a142a126a143 a132 a104a96a106a139a138 a68a144a69a145a140a66 a67a146a142 a135a133a136 and a132 a108 a138 a68a70a69a141a140a66 a67a15a142a126a143 a132 a108 a138 a68a144a69a141a140a66 a67a15a142 a135a133a136 are satis ed.
8We tested several bases in the experiments and found there were little difference in performance between them.
245 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Conditions A set of essays9 written by Japanese learners of English was used as the target essays in the experiments.
It consisted of 47 essays (3180 words) on the topic traveling.
A native speaker of English who was a professional rewriter of English recognized 105 target errors in it.
The written part of the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995) was used to learn decision lists.
Sentences the OAK system10, which was used to extract NPs from the corpus, failed to analyze were excluded.
After these operations, the size of the corpus approximately amounted to 80 million words.
Hereafter, the corpus will be referred to as the BNC.
As another corpus, the English concept explication in the EDR English-Japanese Bilingual dictionary and the EDR corpus (1993) were used; it will be referred to as the EDR corpus, hereafter.
Its size amounted to about 3 million words.
Performance of the proposed method was evaluated by recall and precision.
Recall is de ned by No.
of target errors detected correctly No.
of target errors in the target essays a0 (10) Precision is de ned by No.
of target errors detected correctly No.
of detected errors a0 (11) 4.2 Experimental Procedures First, decision lists for each target noun in the target essays were learned from the BNC11.
To extract noun phrases and their head nouns, the OAK system was used.
An optimal value for a24 (window size of context) was estimated as follows.
For 25 nouns shown in (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002) as examples of nouns used as both mass and count nouns, accuracy on the BNC was calculated using ten-fold cross validation.
As a result of setting small (a24a77a51a147a53 ), medium (a24a77a51a78a82a84a119 ), and large (a24a77a51a149a148a40a119 ) window sizes, it turned out that a24a150a51a151a53 maximized the average accuracy.
Following this result, a24a65a51a89a53 was selected in the experiments.
Second, the target nouns were distinguished whether they were mass or count by the learned 9http://www.eng.ritsumei.ac.jp/lcorpus/.
10OAK System Homepage: http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/oak/.
11If no instance of the target noun is found in the general corpora (and also in the feedback corpus in case of the feedback-augmented method), the target noun is ignored in the error detection procedure.
decision lists, and then the target errors were detected by applying the detection rules to the mass count distinction.
As a preprocessing, spelling errors were corrected using a spell checker.
The results of the detection were compared to those done by the native-speaker of English.
From the comparison, recall and precision were calculated.
Then, the feedback-augmented method was evaluated on the same target essays.
Each target essay in turn was left out, and all the remaining target essays were used as a feedback corpus.
The target errors in the left-out essay were detected using the feedback-augmented method.
The results of all 47 detections were integrated into one to calculate overall performance.
This way of feedback can be regarded as that one uses revised essays previously written in a class to detect errors in essays on the same topic written in other classes.
Finally, the above two methods were compared with their seven variants shown in Table 5.
DL in Table 5 refers to the nine decision list based methods (the above two methods and their seven variants).
The words in brackets denote the corpora used to learn decision lists; the symbol +FB means that the feedback corpus was simply added to the general corpus.
The subscripts a36a17a152a42a153 and a36a17a152a44a154 indicate that the feedback was done by using Equation (8) and Equation (9), respectively.
In addition to the seven variants, two kinds of earlier method were used for comparison.
One was one (Kawai et al., 1984) of the rule-based methods.
It judges singular head nouns with no determiner to be erroneous since missing articles are most common in the writing of Japanese learners of English.
In the experiments, this was implemented by treating all nouns as count nouns and applying the same detection rules as in the proposed method to the countability.
The other was a web-based method (Lapata and Keller, 2005)12 for generating articles.
It retrieves web counts for queries consisting of two words preceding the NP that the target noun head, one of the articles (a91 a/an, the, a93a17a92 ), and the core NP to generate articles.
All queries are performed as exact matches using quotation marks and submitted to the Google search engine in lower case.
For example, in the case of *She is good sstudent., it retrieves web counts for she is a good student, 12There are other statistical methods that can be used for comparison including Lee (2004) and Minnen (2000).
Lapata and Keller (2005) report that the web-based method is the best performing article generation method.
246 she is the good student, and she is good student . Then, it generates the article that maximizes the web counts.
We extended it to make it capable of detecting our target errors.
First, the singular/plural distinction was taken into account in the queries (e.g., she is a good students, she is the good students, and she is good students in addition to the above three queries).
The one(s) that maximized the web counts was judged to be correct; the rest were judged to be erroneous.
Second, if determiners other than the articles modify head nouns, only the distinction between singular and plural was taken into account (e.g., he has some book vs he has some books ).
In the case of much/many, the target noun in singular form modi ed by much and that in plural form modi ed by many were compared (e.g., he has much furniture vs he has many furnitures).
Finally, some rules were used to detect literal errors.
For example, plural head nouns modi ed by this were judged to be erroneous.
4.3 Experimental
Results and Discussion Table 5 shows the experimental results.
Rulebased and Web-based in Table 5 refer to the rule-based method and the web-based method, respectively.
The other symbols are as already explained in Section 4.2.
As we can see from Table 5, all the decision list based methods outperform the earlier methods.
The rule-based method treated all nouns as count nouns, and thus it did not work well at all on mass nouns.
This caused a lot of false-positives and false-negatives.
The web-based method suffered a lot from other errors than the target errors since Table 5: Experimental results Method Recall Precision DL (BNC) 0.66 0.65 DL (BNC+FB) 0.66 0.65 DLa97a84a98 a153 (BNC) 0.66 0.65 DLa97a84a98 a154 (BNC) 0.69 0.70 DL (EDR) 0.70 0.68 DL (EDR+FB) 0.71 0.69 DLa97a84a98 a153 (EDR) 0.71 0.70 DLa97a84a98 a154 (EDR) 0.71 0.72 DL (FB) 0.43 0.76 Rule-based 0.59 0.39 Web-based 0.49 0.53 it implicitly assumed that there were no errors except the target errors.
Contrary to this assumption, not only did the target essays contain the target errors but also other errors since they were written by Japanese learners of English.
This indicate that the queries often contained the other errors when web counts were retrieved.
These errors made the web counts useless, and thus it did not perform well.
By contrast, the decision list based methods did because they distinguished mass and count nouns by one of the words around the target noun that was most likely to be effective according to the log-likelihood ratio13; the best performing decision list based method (DLa97a84a98 a154 (EDR)) is signi cantly superior to the best performing14 nondecision list based method (Web-based) in both recall and precision at the 99% con dence level.
Table 5 also shows that the feedback-augmented methods bene t from feedback.
Only an exception is DLa97a84a98 a153 (BNC) . The reason is that the size of BNC is far larger than that of the feedback corpus and thus it did not affect the performance.
This also explains that simply adding the feedback corpus to the general corpus achieved little or no improvement as DL (EDR+FB) and DL (BNC+FB) show.
Unlike these, both DLa97a84a98 a154 (BNC) and DLa97a84a98 a154 (EDR) bene t from feedback since the effect of the general corpus is limited to some extent by the log function in Equation (9).
Because of this, both bene t from feedback despite the differences in size between the feedback corpus and the general corpus.
Although the experimental results have shown that the feedback-augmented method is effective to detecting the target errors in the writing of Japanese learners of English, even the best performing method (DLa97a84a98 a154 (EDR)) made 30 falsenegatives and 29 false-positives.
About 70% of the false-negatives were errors that required other sources of information than the mass count distinction to be detected.
For example, extra definite articles (e.g., *the traveling) cannot be detected even if the correct mass count distinction is given.
Thus, only a little improvement is expected in recall however much feedback corpus data become available.
On the other hand, most of the 13Indeed, words around the target noun were effective.
The default rules were used about 60% and 30% of the time in DL (EDR) and DL (BNC), respectively; when only the default rules were used, DL (EDR) ( DL (BNC) ) achieved 0.66 (0.56) in recall and 0.58 (0.53) in precision.
14 Best
performing here means best performing in terms of a155 -measure.
247 false-positives were due to the decision lists themselves.
Considering this, it is highly possible that precision will improve as the size of the feedback corpus increases.
5 Conclusions
This paper has proposed a feedback-augmented method for distinguishing mass and count nouns to complement the conventional rules for detecting grammatical errors.
The experiments have shown that the proposed method detected 71% of the target errors in the writing of Japanese learners of English with a precision of 72% when it was augmented by feedback.
From the results, we conclude that the feedback-augmented method is effective to detecting errors concerning the articles and singular plural usage in the writing of Japanese learners of English.
Although it is not taken into account in this paper, the feedback corpus contains further useful information.
For example, we can obtain training data consisting of instances of errors by comparing the feedback corpus with its original corpus.
Also, comparing it with the results of detection, we can know performance of each rule used in the detection, which make it possible to increase or decrease their log-likelihood ratios according to their performance.
We will investigate how to exploit these sources of information in future work.
