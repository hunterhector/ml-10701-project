It can be used to specify the states of a left; to right parser and the possible mappings 10etween states, l"or example, Milward (:1992b) provides a dynamic description o\[' a shift reduce l)arscr, and a dynamic description of a fully incremental parser I)asod on dependency grammar.

Some of the problelns with eategorial granlmar accounts of coordination do reoccur with a dynamic acconnt based on the parser used ill Milward (1992a).

In Milward (1992a), the dynarnics specifies a word-by-word incremental parser lbr a lexicalised version of dependency gramlnar.
