(Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006) focuses on how to use acoustic information alone to help predict sentences to be included in a summary and shows a novel way of using continuous HMMs for summarizing speech documents without transcriptions.

Alternatively, some methods which are independent of lexical features are presented (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).

Considering the difficulty in obtaining high quality transcriptions, some researchers proposed speech summarization systems with non-lexical features (Inoue et al., 2004; Koumpis and Renals, 2005; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).

The similar conclusion also holds for speech summarization on English sources (Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).
