SDRT for document structuring In (Danlos et al., 2001) we advocate using sdrt (Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (Asher, 1993; Asher and Lascarides, 1998)) as a discourse framework, since sdrt and drt (Discourse Representation Theory, (Kamp and Reyle, 1993)) are the most popular frameworks for formal and computational semantics.

We refer the reader to (El Ghali, 2001) for the content determination module, to (Danlos et al., 2001) for the document structuring module and to Danlos (1998; 2000) for the lexicalized tactical component.
