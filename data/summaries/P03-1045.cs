In particular: (A = B;A) 6‘ A, where A = D0 This construction is in some sense more complex than those for the other systems (Foret and Le Nir, 2002a; Foret and Le Nir, 2002b) since they do not directly translate as limit points in the more restricted system NL.

The extension of such results for Lambek grammars is an interesting challenge that is addressed by works on logic types from (Dudau-Sofronie et al., 2001) (these grammars enjoy a direct link with Montague semantics), learning from structures in (Retor and Bonato, september 2001), complexity results from (Florˆencio, 2002) or unlearnability results from (Foret and Le Nir, 2002a; Foret and Le Nir, 2002b); this result was shown for several variants but the question was left open for the basic variant, the nonassociative variant NL.
