Abstract
We propose a new method for query-oriented
extractive multi-document summarization. To
enrich the information need representation of
a given query, we build a co-occurrence graph
to obtain words that augment the original
query terms. We then formulate the sum-
marization problem as a Maximum Coverage
Problem with Knapsack Constraints based on
word pairs rather than single words. Our
experiments with the NTCIR ACLIA ques-
tion answering test collections show that our
method achieves a pyramid F3-score of up to
0.313, a 36% improvement over a baseline us-
ing Maximal Marginal Relevance.
1 Introduction
Automatic text summarization aims at reducing the
amount of text the user has to read while preserv-
ing important contents, and has many applications
in this age of digital information overload (Mani,
2001). In particular, query-oriented multi-document
summarization is useful for helping the user satisfy
his information need efficiently by gathering impor-
tant pieces of information from multiple documents.
In this study, we focus on extractive summariza-
tion (Liu and Liu, 2009), in particular, on sentence
selection from a given set of source documents that
contain relevant sentences. One well-known chal-
lenge in selecting sentences relevant to the informa-
tion need is the vocabulary mismatch between the
query (i.e. information need representation) and the
candidate sentences. Hence, to enrich the informa-
tion need representation, we build a co-occurrence
graph to obtain words that augment the original
query terms. We call this method Query Snowball.
Another challenge in sentence selection for
query-oriented multi-document summarization is
how to avoid redundancy so that diverse pieces of
information (i.e. nuggets (Voorhees, 2003)) can be
covered. For penalizing redundancy across sen-
tences, using single words as the basic unit may not
always be appropriate, because different nuggets for
a given information need often have many words
in common. Figure 1 shows an example of this
word overlap problem from the NTCIR-8 ACLIA2
Japanese question answering test collection. Here,
two gold-standard nuggets for the question “Sen to
Chihiro no Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) is a full-
length animated movie from Japan. The user wants
to know how it was received overseas.” (in English
translation) is shown. Each nugget represents a par-
ticular award that the movie received, and the two
Japanese nugget strings have as many as three words
in common: “w�(review/critic)”, “���(ani-
mation)” and “	�(award).” Thus, if we use single
words as the basis for penalising redundancy in sen-
tence selection, it would be difficult to cover both of
these nuggets in the summary because of the word
overlaps.
We therefore use word pairs as the basic unit for
computing sentence scores, and then formulate the
summarization problem as a Maximum Cover Prob-
lem with Knapsack Constraints (MCKP) (Filatova
and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004; Takamura and Oku-
mura, 2009a). Thisproblemisanoptimizationprob-
lem that maximizes the total score of words covered
by a summary under a summary length limit.

We e aluate our proposed method using Japanese
complex question answering test collections from
NTCIR ACLIA–Advanced Cross-lingual Informa-
tion Access task (Mitamura et al., 2008; Mitamura
et al., 2010). However, our method can easily be
extended for handling other languages.
2 Related
Work
Much work has been done for generic multi-
document summarization (Takamura and Okumura,
2009a; Takamura and Okumura, 2009b; Celiky-
ilmaz and Hakkani-Tur, 2010; Lin et al., 2010a;
Lin and Bilmes, 2010). Carbonell and Goldstein
(1998) proposed the Maximal Marginal Relevance
(MMR) criteria for non-redundant sentence selec-
tion, which consist of document similarity and re-
dundancy penalty. McDonald (2007) presented
an approximate dynamic programming approach to
maximize the MMR criteria. Yih et al. (2007)
formulated the document summarization problem
as an MCKP, and proposed a supervised method.
Whereas, our method is unsupervised. Filatova
and Hatzivassiloglou (2004) also formulated sum-
marization as an MCKP, and they used two types
of concepts in documents: single words and events
(named entity pairs with a verb or a noun). While
their work was for generic summarization, our
method is designed specifically for query-oriented
summarization.
MMR-based methods are also popular for query-
oriented summarization (Jagarlamudi et al., 2005;
Li et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2010; Lin et al.,
2010b). Moreover, graph-based methods for sum-
marization and sentence retrieval are popular (Otter-
bacher et al., 2005; Varadarajan and Hristidis, 2006;
Bosma, 2009). Unlike existing graph-based meth-
ods, our method explicitly computes indirect rela-
tionships between the query and words in the docu-
ments to enrich the information need representation.
To this end, our method utilizes within-sentence co-
occurrences of words.
The approach taken by Jagarlamudi et al. (2005)
issimilartoourproposedmethodinthatitusesword
co-occurrence and dependencies within sentences in
order to measure relevance of words to the query.
However, while their approach measures the generic
relevance of each word based on Hyperspace Ana-
logue to Language (Lund and Burgess, 1996) using
an external corpus, our method measures the rele-
vance of each word within the document contexts,
and the query relevance scores are propagated recur-
sively.
3 Proposed
Method
Section 3.1 introduces the Query Snowball (QSB)
method which computes the query relevance score
for each word. Then, Section 3.2 describes how
we formulate the summarization problem based on
word pairs.
3.1 Query
Snowball method (QSB)
The basic idea behind QSB is to close the gap
between the query (i.e. information need rep-
resentation) and relevant sentences by enriching
the information need representation based on co-
occurrences. To this end, QSB computes a query
relevance score for each word in the source docu-
ments as described below.
Figure 2 shows the concept of QSB. Here, Q is
the set of query terms (each represented by q), R1
is the set of words (r1) that co-occur with a query
terminthesamesentence, andR2isthesetofwords
(r2) that co-occur with a word from R1, excluding
those that are already in R1. The imaginary root
node at the center represents the information need,
and we assume that the need is propagated through
this graph, where edges represent within-sentence
co-occurrences. Thus, to compute sentence scores,
we use not only the query terms but also the words
in R1 and R2.
Our first clue for computing a word score is
the query-independent importance of the word.

Figure 2: Co-occurrence Graph (Query Snowball)
We represent this base word score by sb(w) =
log(N/ctf (w)) or sb(w) = log(N/n(w)), where
ctf (w) is the total number of occurrences of w
within the corpus and n(w) is the document fre-
quency of w, and N is the total number of docu-
ments in the corpus. We will refer to these two ver-
sions as itf and idf, respectively. Our second clue
is the weight propagated from the center of the co-
occurence graph shown in Figure 1. Below, we de-
scribe how to compute the word scores for words in
R1 and then those for words in R2.
As Figure 2 suggests, the query relevance score
for r1 ∈ R1 is computed based not only on its base
word score but also on the relationship between r1
and q ∈ Q. To be more specific, let freq(w,wprime)
denote the within-sentence co-occurrence frequency
for words w and wprime, and let distance(w,wprime) denote
the minimum dependency distance between w and
wprime: A dependency distance is the path length be-
tween nodes w and wprime within a dependency parse
tree; the minimum dependency distance is the short-
est path length among all dependency parse trees of
source-document sentences in which w and wprime co-
occur. Then, the query relevance score for r1 can be
computed as:
sr(r1)=∑
q∈Q
sb(r1)
(s
b(q)
sumQ
)( freq(q,r1)
distance(q,r1)+1.0
)
(1)
wheresumQ = ∑q∈Q sb(q). Itcanbeobservedthat
the query relevance score sr(r1) reflects the base
word scores of both q and r1, as well as the co-
occurrence frequency freq(q,r1). Moreover, sr(r1)
depends on distance(q,r1), the minimum depen-
dency distance between q and r1, which reflects
the strength of relationship between q and r1. This
quantity is used in one of its denominators in Eq.1
as small values of distance(q,r1) imply a strong re-
lationship between q and r1. The 1.0 in the denom-
inator avoids division by zero.
Similarly, the query relevance score for r2 ∈ R2
is computed based on the base word score of r2 and
the relationship between r2 and r1 ∈ R1:
sr(r2)=∑
r1∈R1
sb(r2)
(s
r(r1)
sumR1
)( freq(r1,r2)
distance(r1,r2)+1.0
)
(2)
where sumR1 =∑r1∈R1sr(r1).
3.2 Score
Maximization Using Word Pairs
Having determined the query relevance score, the
nextstepistodefinethesummaryscore. Tothisend,
weusewordpairsratherthanindividualwordsasthe
basic unit. This is because word pairs are more in-
formativ for discriminating across different pieces
of information than single common words. (Re-
call the example mentioned in Section 1) Thus, the
word pair score is simply defined as: sp(w1,w2) =
sr(w1)sr(w2) and the summary score is computed
as:
fQSBP(S) =
∑
{w1,w2|w1negationslash=w2 and w1,w2∈u and u∈S}
sp(w1,w2) (3)
where u is a textual unit, which in our case is a
sentence. Our problem then is to select S to maxi-
mize fQSBP(S). The above function based on word
pairs is still submodular, and therefore we can apply
a greedy approximate algorithm with performance
guarantee as proposed in previous work (Khuller
et al., 1999; Takamura and Okumura, 2009a). Let
l(u) denote the length of u. Given a set of source
documents D and a length limit L for a sum-
mary,
Require: D,L
1: W = D,S = φ
2: while W negationslash= φ do
3: u = argmaxu∈W f(S∪{u})−f(S)l(u)
4: if l(u) +∑uS∈S l(uS) ≤ L then
5: S = S ∪{u}
6: end if
7: W = W/{u}
8: end while
9: umax = argmaxu∈D f(u)
10: if f(umax) > f(S) then
11: return umax
12: else return S
13: end if
where f(·) is some score function such as fQSBP.
We call our proposed method QSBP: Query Snow-
ball with Word Pairs.

Table 1: ACLIA dataset statistics
We evaluate our method using Japanese QA test
collections from NTCIR-7 ACLIA1 and NTCIR-
8 ACLIA2
(Mitamura et al., 2008; Mitamura et
al., 2010). The collections contain complex ques-
tions and their answer nuggets with weights. Ta-
ble 1 shows some statistics of the data. We use the
ACLIA1 development data for tuning a parameter
for our baseline as shown in Section 4.2 (whereas
our proposed method is parameter-free), and the
ACLIA1 and ACLIA2 test data for evaluating dif-
ferent methods The results for the ACLIA1 test data
are omitted due to lack of space. As our aim is
to answer complex questions by means of multi-
document summarization, we removed factoid ques-
tions from the ACLIA2 test data.
Although the ACLIA test collections were origi-
nally designed for Japanese QA evaluation, we treat
them as query-oriented summarization test collec-
tions. We use all the candidate documents from
which nuggets were extracted as input to the multi-
document summarizers. That is, in our problem set-
ting, the relevant documents are already given, al-
though the given document sets also occasionally
contain documents that were eventually never used
for nugget extraction (Mitamura et al., 2008; Mita-
mura et al., 2010).
We preprocessed the Japanese documents basi-
cally by automatically detecting sentence bound-
aries based on Japanese punctuation marks, but we
also used regular-expression-based heuristics to de-
tect glossary of terms in articles. As the descrip-
tions of these glossaries are usually very useful for
answering BIOGRAPHY and DEFINITION ques-
tions, we treated each term description (generally
multiple sentences) as a single sentence.
We used Mecab (Kudo et al., 2004) for morpho-
logical analysis, and calculated base word scores
sb(w) using Mainichi articles from 1991 to 2005.
We also used Mecab to convert each word to its base
form and to filter using POS tags to extract content
words. As for dependency parsing for distance com-
putation, we used Cabocha (Kudo and Matsumoto,
2000). We did not use a stop word list or any other
external knowledge.
Following the NTCIR-9 one click access task
setting1, we aimed at generating summaries of
Japanese 500 characters or less. To evaluate the
summaries, we followed the practices at the TAC
summarization tasks (Dang, 2008) and NTCIR
ACLIA tasks, and computed pyramid-based preci-
sion with an allowance parameter of C, recall, Fβ
(where β is 1 or 3) scores. The value of C was
determined based on the average nugget length for
each question type of the ACLIA2 collection (Mita-
muraetal.,2010). Precisionandrecallarecomputed
based on the nuggets that the summary covered as
well as their weights. The first author of this paper
manually evaluated whether each nugget matches a
summary. The evaluation metrics are formally de-
fined as follows:
precision = min
(C·(sharpof matchednuggets)
summarylength ,1
),
recall = sumof weightsovermatchednuggetssumof weightsoverallnuggets ,
Fβ = (1+β
2)·precision·recall
β2 ·recision+recall .
4.2 Baseline
MMR is a popular approach in query-oriented sum-
marization. For example, at the TAC 2008 opin-
ion summarization track, a top performer in terms
of pyramid F score used an MMR-based method.
Our own implementation of an MMR-based base-
line uses an existing algorithm to maximize the fol-
lowing summary set score function (Lin and Bilmes,
2010):
fMMR(S) =γ(∑
u∈S
Sim(u,vD)+∑
u∈S
Sim(u,vQ))
−(1−γ) ∑
{(ui,uj)|inegationslash=j andui,uj∈S}
Sim(ui,uj) (4)
wherevD is the vector representing the source docu-
ments, vQ is the vector representing the query terms,
Sim is the cosine similarity, and γ is a parameter.

226
Thus, the first term of this function reflects how the
sentences reflect the entire documents; the second
term reflects the relevance of the sentences to the
query; and finally the function penalizes redundant
sentences. We set γ to 0.8 and the scaling factor
used in the algorithm to 0.3 based on a preliminary
experiment with a part of the ACLIA1 development
data. We also tried incorporating sentence position
information (Radev, 2001) to our MMR baseline but
this actually hurt performance in our preliminary ex-
periments.
4.3 Variants
of the Proposed Method
To clarify the contributions of each components, the
minimum dependency distance, QSB and the word
pair, we also evaluated the following simplified ver-
sions of QSBP. (We use the itf version by default,
and will refer to the idf version as QSBP(idf). ) To
examine the contribution of using minimum depen-
dency distance, We remove distance(w,wprime) from
Eq.1 and Eq.2. We call the method QSBP(nodist).
To examine the contribution of using word pairs for
score maximization (see Section 3.2) on the perfor-
mance of QSBP, we replaced Eq.3 with:
fQSB(S) =
∑
{w|w∈ui and ui∈S}
sr(w) . (5)
To examine the contribution of the QSB relevance
scoring (see Section 3.1) on the performance of
QSBP, we replaced Eq.3 with:
fWP(S) =
∑
{w1,w2|w1negationslash=w2 and w1,w2∈ui and ui∈S}
sb(w1)sb(w2) . (6)
We will refer to this as WP. Note that this relies only
on base word scores and is query-independent.
4.4 Results
Tables 2 and 3 summarize our results. We used
the two-tailed sign test for testing statistical signif-
icance. Significant improvements over the MMR
baseline are marked with a † (α=0.05) or a ‡
(α=0.01); those over QSBP(nodist) are marked with
a sharp (α=0.05) or a sharpsharp (α=0.01); and those over QSB
are marked with a • (α=0.05) or a •• (α=0.01); and
those over WP are marked with a star (α=0.05) or a
starstar (α=0.01). From Table 2, it can be observed that
bothQSBPandQSBP(idf)significantlyoutperforms
QSBP(nodist), QSB, WP and the baseline in terms
of all evaluation metrics. Thus, the minimum depen-
dency distance, Query Snowball and the use of word
pairs all contribute significantly to the performance
of QSBP. Note that we are using the ACLIA data as
summarization test collections and that the official
QA results of ACLIA should not be compared with
ours.
QSBP and QSBP(idf) achieve 0.312 and 0.313 in
F3 score, and the differences between the two are
not statistically significant. Table 3 shows the F3
scores for each question type. It can be observed
that QSBP is the top performer for BIO, DEF and
REL questions on average, while QSBP(idf) is the
top performer for EVENT and WHY questions on
average. It is possible that different word scoring
methods work well for different question types.

5 Conclusions
and Future work
We proposed the Query Snowball (QSB) method for
query-oriented multi-document summarization. To
enrichtheinformationneedrepresentationofagiven
query, QSB obtains words that augment the original
query terms from a co-occurrence graph. We then
formulated the summarization problem as an MCKP
based on word pairs rather than single words. Our
method, QSBP, achieves a pyramid F3-score of up
to 0.313 with the ACLIA2 Japanese test collection,
a 36% improvement over a baseline using Maximal
Marginal Relevance.
Moreover, as the principles of QSBP are basically
language independent, we will investigate the effec-
tiveness of QSBP in other languages. Also, we plan
to extend our approach to abstractive summariza-
tion.
