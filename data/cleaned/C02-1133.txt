Analysis of Titles and Readers – For Title Generation Centered on the Readers Yasuko Senda†‡ and Yasusi Sinohara† †Communication & Information Research Laboratory Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry, Japan ‡Department of Computational Intelligence and Systems Science Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan {senda, sinohara}@criepi.denken.or.jp Abstract The title of a document has two roles, to give a compact summary and to lead the reader to read the document.
Conventional title generation focuses on finding key expressions from the author’s wording in the document to give a compact summary and pays little attention to the reader’s interest.
To make the title play its second role properly, it is indispensable to clarify the content (“what to say”) and wording (“how to say”) of titles that are eﬀective to attract the target reader’s interest.
In this article, we first identify typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers in a comparative study between titles of technical papers and headlines rewritten for newspapers.
Next, we describe the results of a questionnaire survey on the eﬀects of the content and wording of titles on the reader’s interest.
The survey of general and knowledgeable readers shows both common and diﬀerent tendencies in interest.
1 Introduction
The title is expected to play two roles.
One is to give the reader a very compact summary of the document, and the other is to attract the target reader’s interest and lead the reader to read the document.
It is preferable that a title plays both roles, because the reader may be disappointed with a gap between the title and the document if the title plays the former role poorly, and the reader may not read the document if the title plays the latter role poorly.
Therefore, it is very important what title is attached to a document.
Several techniques have been reported on generating titles (Jin and Hauptmann, 2000)(Berger and Mittal, 2000), and they focus on the former role, that is, to give a compact summary.
The main approach is to find a few keywords from the document by calculating the importance of each word in the document.
This approach, incidentally, is similar to most text summarization techniques.
The selected keywords or title strongly reflect the author’s wordings.
In other words, this approach is an “author-centered approach”.
In some cases, the title generated by this approach might play the latter role poorly and fail to get the reader’s interest.
To make generated titles play their latter role properly, it is not suﬃcient to look into only the author’s document.
It is important to also pay more attention to the reader.
It is necessary in the “reader-centered approach” to clarify the features of the reader’s attention, that is, the relationship between the reader’s attention and the content and wording of the title.
Based on this knowledge, it will be possible to extract information from the document that is more attractive to the reader than the author’s key expressions and to include it in the generated title.
Our first goal is to clarify the kind of content and wording that are key to getting the reader’s comprehension, interest in, and positive feeling toward the document.
For this purpose, we first conducted a comparative study on the titles of technical papers and headlines rewritten for newspapers to identify the typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers.
We then conducted a questionnaire survey on the eﬀects of diﬀerent content and wording of titles on diﬀerent kinds of readers’ interest.
The following sections are as follows: section 2 describes the comparative study and its results, section 3 and 4 explain the details and the results of our questionnaire survey, and section 5 relates our conclusion and future work.
2 Comparison
between Paper Titles and Newspaper Headlines To identify the typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers, we conducted a comparative study on the Japanese titles of research papers and the headlines of Japanese newspaper articles describing the corresponding technology.
We first divided the titles and headlines into several syntactic components (text segments) and assigned each component a syntactic function tag, such as “P(urpose of development)” and “M(ethod for realization)”, and then comparatively analyzed the expression of paper title and headlines on the basis of each component.
2.1 Overview
of Collected Documents Table 1 shows the outlines of collected documents, including research papers (articles and technical reports) and newspaper articles (from three trade newspapers and one general newspaper).
The Japanese titles and headlines were retrieved from a document database at a research institute.
They cover science and technology at large.
We identified one or a few technical papers closely related to about 90% of the headlines.
2.2 Syntactic
Function Tags We found that most text segments of the collected titles and headlines could be classified into the following syntactic function tags.
Here, we define each syntactic function tag and describe the tagging process we used in the analysis.
B(ehavior): Behavior is expressed by a verbal noun or verb.
For example, in the title “Development of an Exploration System of Buried Cables”, the word “exploration” describes the main behavior or action of the developed technology and is assigned the tag “B”.
O(bject): The object is a noun phrase in the objective case of the verbal noun of behavior “B”.
In the above example, the compound noun “buried cables” is assigned the tag “O”.
T(echnology type): The words assigned the tag “T”(echnology type) are very restricted and include such words as “system”, “model” and “method”.
They express the form of the developed technology.
P(urpose): The purpose of development is usually expressed by a noun phrase following a preposition, such as “for” (“no tame-ni/no” in Japanese).
(e.g., “for power distribution cables under pavements”) M(ethod): The tag “M” stands for the method for realization and is expressed by a noun phrase following a preposition, such as “by” (“ni yori” in Japanese).
(e.g., “by underground radar”) S(trong point): “S” stands for the advantage or merit of the developed technology.
It is usually expressed by an adjective or adverb phrase.
(e.g., “highly accurate”).
D(evelopment): “D” stands for the expression that frequently appears in paper titles and headlines, such as “the development of”, “the evaluation of”, and “a study on”.
E(t alia): There are several text segments that do not fall into the above seven categories.
They appear mainly in newspaper headlines.
Two examples are names of development organizations and descriptions of the issue for practical use of the technology.
We excluded the two tags “D” and “E” in a comparative analysis because they do not directly relate to the content of the developed technology.
2.3 Tagging
Process As for paper titles (in Japanese), we divided them semiautomaticallyaccording to the following pattern P?
M? S?
O S?
B S?
T? D?
(Each alphabet means syntactic function tag.
“?” means “either zero times or one time”.) using the “ChaSen” Japanese morphological analyzer (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2000) and syntactic clues (such as word order, syntactic category and specific prepositions).
The results are reviewed and errors are manually corrected.
As for headlines, automatic tagging is diﬃcult because of the frequent use of verbal omissions and inversion.
Therefore, we manually divided the headlines.
In order to improve the precision of human tagging as highly as possible, the human tagger divided them according to the following procedure.
1. Find the verbs (or verbal nouns).
Table 1: Features of Documents Used in the Comparison of Their Titles or Headlines Kind of Target Author Publication Number of Documents Reader Date Documents 1 Article Researcher Researcher ’89–’00 1464 2 Technical Report General Researcher ’80–’00 2861 y Reader 3 Trade on the Power Industry 531 4 Newspaper on Technology General Newspaperman ’88–’98 313 5 on the Economy Reader 203 6 General Newspaper 364 Table 2: Components Included in the Title of Technical Papers Each Syntactic Component’s Function Syntactic Category Specific Expression or Preposition Frequency B Behavior of the Technology Verbal Noun > 80% O Object of the Behavior Noun Phrase Japanese particle “wo” > 80% M Method for Realizing Noun Phrase Japanese expression “ni yori”, etc.
< 30% (such as “by” in English) S Strong Point Adjective/Adverb Phrase < 30% P Purpose of Development Noun Phrase Japanese expression “no tame ni/no”, etc.
< 30% (such as “for” in English) T Technology type Noun 58% D Development Noun Japanese expression “no kaihatsu”, etc.
(such as “development of”) 2.
Determine the verb (or verbal noun) which corresponds to “B” using syntactic and semantic clues (such as special prepositions and semantic modification relations).
3. Identify the other components which modify “B” using the clues used in the above step 2.
2.4 Comparative
Analysis We analyzed the results of the above tagging in the following two ways.
1. The diﬀerence in the frequency of the six main components with tag B(ehavior), O(bject), M(ethod), S(trong point), P(urpose) and T(echnology type) in paper titles and headlines.
2. The diﬀerence in the expression of the same syntactic components in paper titles and headlines.
2.5 Obligatory
and Optional Components The last column in Table 2 indicates the frequency of the occurrence of each tag in titles and headlines.
The components (text segments) with tags “B”, “O”, and “T” appear more than 80%, 80%, and 58%, respectively, in titles and headlines 1. We call these high-frequency components “obligatory component” and the other components with “P”, “M”, and “S”, “optional components” . 2.5.1 Obligatory Components Obligatory components are important because they are essential in reporting the substance of the technology to the reader.
By comparing the expression of the obligatory components (labeled “T”, “B”, and “O”), we categorized the diﬀerence of the expression into two points.
One is that technical jargons are used in paper titles while plain terms are used in headlines to express the same thing.
The other is that in the obligatory component the title explains the concrete content of the tech1 “B” and “O” appear 100% in the paper titles and 80% in the headlines because verbal omissions sometimes occur in newspaper headlines.
nology while the headline expresses the purpose of the technology, which general readers can understand.
In other words, we identified two expressing techniques of newspapermen.
Instead of using technical jargons, the plain synonymous terms are used.
Instead of expressing what the technology does, they express what the purpose of the technology is.
An example of the former in English is as follows: Title: Method to Shorten Radioactive Half-life Headline: Method to Shorten the Duration of Radiation An example of the latter is as follows: Title: Method to Shorten Radioactive Half-life Headline: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Radioactive Waste The expression patterns typical in obligatory components are summarized in Table 3.
It is arranged from the two viewpoints of “what to say” and “how to say”.
2.5.2 Optional
Components By comparing the expression of the optional components, in the “M” component we found that technical jargons are frequently used in paper titles while plain terms are used in headlines.
Moreover, by analyzing the frequency of component combinations, we found that the combination of optional components with “M” and “S” is seldom used in any title or headline.
We also found that the use of “M” in titles is more frequent than in headlines while the description of the advantages (“S”) in headlines is five times more frequent than in titles.
The analysis suggests that the description of “M” found in paper titles are omitted in headlines and the description of advantages (“S”) are used in headlines.
The expressing techniques we identified are as follows: Instead of using technical jargons, the plain synonymous terms are used in the “M” component.
Instead of expressing the method of realizing the technology, they express the advantage (“S”) of the technology.
An example of the former in English is as follows.
Title: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Radioactive Waste by Metallic Fuel FBR Headline: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Radioactive Waste by Burnout An example of the latter is as follows: Title: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Radioactive Waste by Metallic Fuel FBR Headline: Method to Shorten Storage Period of Radioactive Waste by 1/10000 The expression patterns typical in optional components are summarized in Table 4.
The table is also arranged from the two viewpoints of “what to say” and “how to say”, as in Table 3.
3 Questionnaire
Survey In this section, we explain the details of our questionnaire survey.
3.1 Viewpoint
of the Survey We assume that the factors which aﬀect the reader’s impression of a title which expresses newly developed technology are the following: F1 Mode of expression for titles (in other word, the expression patterns) F2 Whether or not the reader has an interest in the technical field F3 The reader’s level of expertise in the technical field Therefore, in order to clarify what kind of impression the title based on each expression pattern (F1) gives the reader, we should investigate how the impressions that each reader who diﬀers in F2 and F3 receives change with each expression pattern.
We then prepared our questionnaire survey according to the following procedures.
1. Select the technical fields for the survey (we selected three fields: electric transmission, architectural engineering, and environmental science).
2. Categorize the respondents by their interest in each technical field and their expertise in that field.
3. Generate titles describing new technologies in the three technical fields by using expression patterns Table 3: Expression Patterns in Obligatory Components What to Pattern 1 Pattern 2 say (What the technology does) (What the purpose of the technology is) How to Pattern 1.1 Pattern 1.2 Pattern 2.0 say (Using technical jargon) (in plain terms) (in plain terms) T(ype) Method Method Method B(ehavior) to Shorten to Shorten to Shorten O(bject) Radioactive Half-life theDurationofRadiation Storage Period of Radioactive Waste Table 4: Expression Patterns in Optional Components What to Pattern 3 Pattern 4 say (What the method of realizing the technology is) (What the strong point of the technology is) How to Pattern 3.1 Pattern 3.2 Pattern 4.0 say (Using technical jargon) (in plain terms) (in plain terms) T(ype) Method Method Method B(ehavior) to Shorten to Shorten to Shorten O(bject) Storage Period of Radioactive Waste Storage Period of Radioactive Waste Storage Period of Radioactive Waste M(ethod) by Metallic Fuel FBR by Burnout S(trong Point) by 1/10000 4.
Draw up a questionnaire which asks the respondents what kind of impression they had when they read each generated title.
In the following three subsections, we explain the details of the above procedures step 2, 3 and 4, in order.
3.2 Categorization
of Respondents In order to categorize the respondents by their interest in each technical field and their expertise of that field, we asked the respondents two questions in the preliminary questionnaire.
One asked them if they were concerned/unconcerned with one of the three technical fields, and the other asked them about their main source of information (three options: general newspaper, trade newspaper, and academic journal, were given, if they were concerned).
We categorized them into two types (“Unconcerned” and “Concerned”) by the former question.
We then categorized “Concerned” into three types (“Commoner”, “Engineer” and “Researcher”, whose main sources of information are general newspaper, trade newspaper and academic journal in turn).
by the latter question.
We labeled “Unconcerned” and three types of “Concerned” (“Commoner”, “Engineer” and “Researcher”) as readership.
Table 5 shows the number of respondents by readership.
3.3 Titles
Prepared for Our Questionnaire In this section, we explain the method for composing the titles used in the questionnaire.
The procedure for composing the titles follows.
1. Select three new technologies in each of the three technical fields, which were developed in a research institute.
2. Retrieve the phrases of titles and headlines concerning each technology, from the document database of the institute, that correspond to each expression pattern.
3. Combine the phrases to compose twelve titles per each technology, using three types of obligatory component expression pattern of by four types of optional component expression pattern (including a pattern without optional components).
The total number of the titles per one field is 36 (twelve titles by three fields).
Table 5: Number of Respondents Unconcerned Concerned Commoner Engineer Researcher Electric Transmission 151 114 69 48 Architectural Engineering 168 115 62 45 Environmental Science 108 153 71 53 We divided thirty six titles per each field into four groups (each group consists of nine titles).
The breakdown of the nine titles is three types of obligatory component expression pattern by three types of optional component expression pattern.
We randomly divided the respondents of each readership into four groups and then asked four groups of the respondents about the impression of four groups of the titles respectively.
3.4 Contents
of Our Questionnaire In order to investigate whether each prepared title is eﬀective in getting each readership’s comprehension, positive feelings, and interest, we asked the respondents the following questions in turn.
Do you think the title is comprehensible?
Do you feel positive toward the technology after reading this?
Do you want to know more about the technology? 3.5 Method Respondents to the questionnaire were the staﬀ of a research institute and monitors of a marketing research firm.
We asked them to answer our questionnaire on a Web page which is prepared for this survey.
4 Diﬀerence in Impression According to Obligatory Component Expression Pattern In this section, we report on the analysis of the correlation between the obligatory component expression pattern in titles and each readership’s impression of the titles.
Figure 1 shows the graph of the percentage of titles regarded as “comprehensible” by the respondents with each readership using each expression pattern.
Figure 2 and 3 also show the ones regarded as “evoked positive feelings”, “interesting” respectively.

Because all significance levels in Table 6 are under 5%, it is confirmed that there exists associations among expression patterns and impressions for each readership.
However, the strength of the associations is low as for the respondents with readership “engineer” or “researcher”, who have expertise, because of lower values of Cramer’s V, while the strength of the association is high as for those who has readership “unconcerned” or “commoner” because of higher values of V.
Because all graphs slope up from left to right in Figures 1, 2 and 3, the expression pattern 2.0 (expressing what the purpose of the technology is) is the most eﬀective to make a title impressive (more precisely, regarded as “comprehensible”, “evoked positive feelings” and “interesting”) for readers with most of readership, especially the “unconcerned” readers or “commoner”.
As for the readers with expertise, other types of expression patterns such as 1.1 or 1.2 should also be considered because of their flatter slopes.
5 Conclusion
and Future Work We emphasized the need for title generation centered on the reader and identified the typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers by conducting a comparative study on paper titles and headlines.
Moreover, we ver2 V = radicalbig X2/N(k−1) where N = total number of cases in the table; k = number of rows or columns, whichever is smaller.
Cramer’s V ranges 0 to 1 where 0 means that the two value variables are perfectly unrelated and 1 means that they are perfectly related.
ified the eﬀects of diﬀerent content and wording of titles.
As a result, titles using expression pattern 2.0 (expressing what the purpose of the technology is) in obligatory component is the most eﬀective in getting the general reader’s comprehension, positive feelings, and interest.
However, the more expertise in a technical field the reader has, the less the reader tends to be influenced.
In future work, we will verify the diﬀerence in impression according to optional component expression patterns by analyzing the results of our questionnaire survey.
We plan to establish the method for generating a title by extracting phrases from the body text and combining them, which correspond to the expression pattern which is eﬀective in getting target reader’s interest.
