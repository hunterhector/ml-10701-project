de Abstract TECHI)OC is an inll)lemellted system demonstrating the flmsibility of gep, erating multilingual technical doeulnellts on the hasis of a lallguage-ill(lel)(mdellt knowledge base.
Its application domain is user and maintenance instructions, which are produced fl:om underlying plan structures tel)resenting the activities, the p;u'ticipatlng objects with their properties, l'ehttions, and so on.
This paper gives a brief outline of the system architecture and discusses some recent developments in the project: the addi-.
tion of actual event simulation in the KII, steps towards ;t document anthm'int,; tool, and a multilnodal user interface.
1. Overview 1.1 Project idea q'he availability of technical docmi~ents in multiph; \]itllgllltg(!s iS ~1, prM)lem of increasing significance.
Not only (h) consumers demand adequate dOCUln(mtal.ion i,l I.heir lnother tongue; there are also h,.I,/M requirclnelfl, s, e.g., with respect to the upcoming European conllllOll nlarket; the product reliability act forces merchants to otl'er complete technical doculnentation in the consmner's native language.
The need to provide such a massive amount of multilingual material is likely to exceed both the c~q)acities of human translators as well as those of nmchine trailslotion technology currently awdlable.
Our work in the TECIII)OC l)roject is motiwtted by the feeling that this situation calls f'()l" investigating a potential alternative: to czI, lOil ",at'ural language gcncralim~ tech'uology in order to help overcome J~,e documentatio.n problem.
TE(~IlI)OC operates in the donlain of tcch'nical man'tzal.s, whMl was selected for two principal reasons.
()n the one hand, tlley i'el)r(!sel,t "real-win'hi" texl;s tlm.t arc actually usel'uh the (lolnain is practical instead o1' ;~ "l.oy worhl".
On the otller hand, the language that is used in such nlamml.~ telldS to })e relatively simple; one mostly finds straiglltf'ot'ward instructions t\]lat have been writtxm with the intention to produce text that can be readily understood by a perSOil WhO iS execlltill\[_,~ SOllie ll\];tintenan(:e &ctivity.
Moreover, as our initial analyses in the Iirst phase o\['TECIlI)O(~ had.shown, the strltclwl'e of nmnua\] sections is largely uniform and anlenahle to l'ormalization.
1.2 Outline
of the generatiorl proccss T/",('.III)()C produces nmintenauce instructions ill l'h,gli~h, (',(.rmzm and French.
The sy.~;l.em is I)ase(l i)n a KI ), encoding technical (h)maiu kuowledge as well as schematic text .'-;I,ructure in IA)OM, a II,-()NE (lialect {I,()OM, I991\].
The macro.~t'ructwrc of a manual section is captured by schemas saying that (if apl)ropriate ) one tirst talks about the location of the object to be l'eI)aired/maintained, then about i)ossil)le r(> l~lacement I)arts/sul)stances; next, the ;mtivities are described, which fall into the three general categories of checking seine attril)ute (('.f';., a lhlid lew!l), adding a substance and replacing ~ l);U't/sulostauee.
These actions are represented as phuls in the I.raditiona.1 A/ sense, i.e. with preand postconditions, and with recursive structure (steps call be elaborated through complete refinement plans).
These representations are mapped onto a language-independent document representation that also captures its microstructure by means of RST relations \[Mann and Thoml> son, 1987\] with a number of specilh: annotations (e.g., a proposition is to be expressed as an instruction, giving rise to inlperative mood).
This document representation is successively transformed into a sequence of sentence plans (together with formatting instructions in a selectahle target format; SGML, IgTEX, Zmacs and --for screen output -slightly formatted ASCII are currently supported), which are handed over to sentence generators.
For English, we use ~Penman' and its sentence planning hmguage (SPL) as input terms, q'o l)roduce German and French text, we have implemented a German version of Pemnan's grammar (NIGEL), which is enhanced I)y a roof phology module, and a fragment of a French grammar in the same way.
For a more detailled description of the system architecture see \[R6sner and Stede, 1992b1.
2 The
Knowledge Base The Knowledge Base is encoded in I,OOM.
In addition to the standard KL-ONE functionality (structured inheritance, separation of terminological and assertional knowledge), LOOM supl)orts object-oriente.d and also rule-based programming.
In addition to tile 'Upper Model' of the Penman generator (a basic ontology that reflects semantic distinctions made by language, \[Bateman, 19901) more.
than 1000 concepts and instances constitute the TECHDOC KB.
They encode the technical knowledge as well as the plan structures that serve as input to the generation process.
The domains currently modeled are end consumer activities in car maintenance and some technical procedures fl'om an aircraft maintenance l~ilanual.
One of the central aims in the design philosophy of the TECtlDOC knowledge t)ase is the separation of domain-independent technical knowledge and specific concepts 1)erraining to the particular domain: the I)orta1)ility of general technical knowledge has been a concern \['rom the beginning.
For instance, knowledge about various types of tanks (with or without imprinted scales, dipsticks, drain bolts) is encoded on an abstract level in tile inheritance network (the 'middle nlodel'), and the particular tanks found in tile engine domain are attached at, the lower end.
Similarly, we have an abstract model of connections (plugs, bolts, etc.), their properties, and the actions pertaining to them (phlg-in cormections can be merely connected or disconnected, screw connections call be tightly or loosely connected, or disconnected).
Objects with the functionality of connections (e.g., spark phlgs) appear at the bottom of the hierarchy.
Thus, when the system is transt\~rred to a dill'e.rent technical domain as experienced recently when we moved to air(:raft manuals ---, large parts of the abstract representation levels are re-usable.
3 Document
Representation Using RST Tile first task undertaken ill TECIIDOC was a thorough analysis of a corpus of pages from multilingual manuals in terms of eonte.nt as well as structure of tile sections.
A text representation lew~l was sought that captured the conuno,mlities of the correponding sections of the (lerman, English and French texts, i.e. l, hal, was not tailored towards one of the spe(:ific languages (for a discussiou of representation levels in multilingual generation, see \[Grote et al., :1993\]).
Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) turned out to 1)e a nsefid formalism: for ahnost every section we investigated, the RST trees for the different language versions were identical.
Our work with RST gave rise to a number of new discourse relations that we found useful in analyzing our texts.
Also, we discovered several general problems with tile theory, regarding the status of minimal units \['or the analysis and the requirement that the 340 text representation be a tree structure all the time (instead of a general graph).
These and other experiences with 1ST are reported in \[E.gsner and Stede, 1992al.
4 Recent
Developments 4.1 Event sinmlation in the knowledge base We developed a detailled represe.ntation of knowledge about actions.
Together with an action concept, preconditions a,M post.conditions can be defined in a declarative way.
The preconditions can I)e checked against the current state of the knowledge base (via BOOM's ASK queries).
If the In'econditions hold, the action can I)e performed and the postconditions are communicated to the knowledge base (with the TEl,l, facility of BOOM).
This typically leads to reclassification of certain technical objects involved.
With the help of BOOM's production rule mechanisnh additional actions either in the knowledge base or on all output medium (e.g., for visualization) can be triggered, lTn this mode, instru(:tion generation is at by-product of simulating the actions that the instructions pertain to.
Being able to take the current stat.e of a technical device into account, its in this simulation mode, is a prerequisite for uI> coming interactiw', applications of instruction generation: devices equil)ped with adequate sensory instruments produce raw data I;hat can 1)e fed directly into tlw kuowle@:e base.
Thereby, the specific situation of the device, e.g., the cltr, drives the instruction generation process, so that only the truly relevant information is given to the user.
4.2 Towards
a document authoring tool A lirst version of an authoring tool has been designed and implemented and tested with a number of users.
The authoring tool allows to interactively build up knowledge base instances of maintenance plans, including the actions and objects involved, and to convert them immediately into documents in the seletted languages.
At, any time, the tool takes the current stal.e of tlle knowledge base into account: all menus offering select:ons dy.namically construct their selection lists, st) that only ol)tions of applieid)le 1,yl)es ;,re offered.
4.3 From
text generation to a multimodal information system The generated t.exts are now displayed with words, groups and phrases and whole sentences being mouse-sensitive and when selected ofl'ering menus with apl)licatfle queries to be directed {,o the underlying knowledge base instances.
'Phis allows for a nmnl)er of tasks to he performed on the generated smface texts, for ex~tmple: • pronouns can \])e asked almut their antecedent referenl,, lingnistic items in the output for one language can he asked about their corresl)onding il.ems in the of, her languages olttl)llt ~ ol)jeets can be asked about their location, answered by a suitable graphic illusl.ration, actions can I)e asked for more detailled instructions ou how to perform them, answered by a short video seqtlence,.
In essence, these facilities haw! p;wed the way t,o mow~ ('ronl stai.ie, hmc|,ive strhw~s as output to an active and dynamic interface for the associated knowledge sources and theh" various presentation modalities.
U'he key is that all information types (lexemes in various languages, images and objeet's location therein, and video sequences) are associated with the underlying 1(15 instances, which are in \[,tlrn linked to 1,heir refi'.rents in the mouse-sensitiw', output text.
l?igure 1 shows a sample screen, where the user has just asked for additional "location" information al)out the dipstick, I)y clicking on the word in one of the text output windows.

A rhetorical structure analysis determines logical relations between sentences based on linguistic clues, such .as connectives, anaphoric expressions, and idiomatic expressions ill the input text, and then recognizes an argumentative chunk of sentences.
Rhetorical structure extraction consists of six major sub-processes: (1) Sentence analysis accomplishes morphological and syntactic analysis for each sentence.
(2) Rhetorical relation extraction detects rhetorical relations and constructs tile sequence of sentence identifiers and relations.
(3) Segmentation detects rhetorical expressions between distant sentences which define rhetorical strncture.
They are added onto tile sequence produced in step 2, and form restrictions for generating structures in step 4.
For example, expressions like "...3 reasons.
First, ...
Second ....
Third,:..",and "...
Of course .... • ..But, "... are extracted and the structural constraint is added onto the sequence so ~s to form a chunk between the expressions.
(4) Candidate generation generates all possible rhetorical strnctures described by binary trees which do not violate segmentatio,, restrictions.
(5) Preference judgement selects tile structure candidate with the lowest penalty score, a wdue determined based on l)reference rules on every two neighboring relations in tile ca,ldidate.
This process selects tile structure candklate with the lowest penalty score, a value determi,wd based on preference rules on every two neighboring relations in the candkhtte.
A preference rule used in this process represents a heuristic local preference on consecutive rhetorical relations between sentences.
Couskler the sequence \[P <EG> t~ <SR> R\], where P, Q, R are arbitrary (blocks of) sentences.
The premise of R is obvously not only t~ but both P aud O.
Since the discussion in e and Q is considered to close locally, structure \[\[p <E(;> Q\] <SR> R\] is preferableto \[P <EG> \[Q <SR> R\]\].
Penalty scores are imposed on thc structure candidates violating the preference rules.
For example, for the text in Fig.
1, the structure candidates which contai,, tile substructure \[3 <EG> F\[4 <gx> 5\] <SR> 6\]\], which says sentence six is the entaihnent of sentence four and five only, are penalized.
The authors have investigated all pairs of rhetorical relations and derived those preference rules.
The system analyzes inter-paragraph structures after the analysis ofiqtra-paragraph structures.
While the system uses the rhetorical relations of the first sentence of each paragraph for this analysis, it executes the same steps as il, does for tile intra -paragraph analysis.
5 ABSTRACT
GENERATION The system generates the abstract of each section of the document by examining its rhetorical structure.
'\['he l)rocess consists of the following 2 stages.
(1) Sentence.
evaluation (2) Structure reduction In the sentence evaluation stage, the system calculate the importance of each sentence in the original text based on the relative importance of rhetorical relations.
They are categorized into three types as shown in Table 2.
For tile relations categorized into ltightNueleus, the right node is more important, from tile point of view of abstract generation, than tile left node.
In the c~se of the LeftNucleus relations, the situatioq is vice versa.
And both nodes of the BothNucleus relations are equivalent in their importance.
For example, since the right node of tile serial relation (e.g., yotte (thus)) is the conclusion of the left node, the relation is categorized into RightN, cleus, and the right node is more iml)ortant than tile left node.
The Actual sentence evahlation is carried out in a den~erlt marking way.
In order to determine important text segments, the system imposes penalties on both nodes for each rhetorical relation according to its relative i,nportance.
The system imposes a peualty oil the left node for tile RightNucleus relatlon, and also oil the right node for tlle LeftNuclevs relation.
It adds penalties from tile root node to tile terminal nodes in turn, to calculate the penalties of all nodes.
Then, in the struelm'e ~vduction stage, tim system recursiw;ly cuts out the nodes, from tile terminal nodes, which are imposed the highest peualty.
The list of terminal nodes of tile final structure becomes an abstract for the original document.
Suppose that the abstract is longer than tile expected length.
