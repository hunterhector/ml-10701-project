Our approach to UNL (described in Boguslavsky et al.2000) is to build a bridge between UNL and one of the internal representations of ETAP, namely Normalized Syntactic Structure (NormSS), and in this way link UNL with all other levels of text representation, including the conventional orthographic form of the text.
