As a final test, we investigated the utility of each feature by using a different tutor action whether or not the tutor should give simple feedback (SimFeed), or a complex feedback response(ComFeed), or a combination of the two (Mix) (Tetreault and Litman, 2006).

The plot shows that the V-values are fairly stable after a few initial cuts, and we also verified that the policies remained stable over the 20 students as well (see our prior work (Tetreault and Litman, 2006) for details of this method).

For our study, we used an annotated corpus of 20 human-computer spoken dialogue tutoring sessions (for our work we use the ITSPOKE system (Litman and Silliman, 2004) which uses the textbased Why2-ATLAS dialogue tutoring system as its “back-end” (VanLehn et al., 2002)).

This paper extends our previous work (Tetreault and Litman, 2006) which first presented a methodology for exploring whether adding more complex features to a representation of student state will beneficially alter tutor actions with respect to feedback.
