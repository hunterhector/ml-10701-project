Abstract
This paper presents a reordering model us-
ing syntactic information of a source tree for
phrase-based statistical machine translation.
The proposed model is an extension of IST-
ITG (imposing source tree on inversion trans-
duction grammar) constraints. In the pro-
posed method, the target-side word order is
obtained by rotating nodes of the source-side
parse-tree. We modeled the node rotation,
monotone or swap, using word alignments
based on a training parallel corpus and source-
side parse-trees. The model efﬁciently sup-
presses erroneous target word orderings, espe-
cially global orderings. Furthermore, the pro-
posed method conducts a probabilistic evalu-
ation of target word reorderings. In English-
to-Japanese and English-to-Chinese transla-
tion experiments, the proposed method re-
sulted in a 0.49-point improvement (29.31 to
29.80) and a 0.33-point improvement (18.60
to 18.93) in word BLEU-4 compared with
IST-ITG constraints, respectively. This indi-
cates the validity of the proposed reordering
model.
1 Introduction
Statistical machine translation has been wiedely ap-
plied in many state-of-the-art translation systems. A
popular statistical machine translation paradigms is
the phrase-based model (Koehn et al., 2003; Och
and Ney, 2004). In phrase-based statistical ma-
chine translation, errors in word reordering, espe-
cially global reordering, are one of the most se-
rious problems. To resolve this problem, many
word-reordering constraint techniques have been
proposed. These techniques are categorized into
two types. The ﬁrst type is linguistically syntax-
based. Inthisapproach,treestructuresforthesource
(Quirk et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2006), target (Ya-
mada and Knight, 2000; Marcu et al., 2006), or both
(Melamed, 2004) are used for model training. The
second type is formal constraints on word permuta-
tions. IBM constraints (Berger et al., 1996), the lex-
ical word reordering model (Tillmann, 2004), and
inversion transduction grammar (ITG) constraints
(Wu, 1995; Wu, 1997) belong to this type of ap-
proach. For ITG constraints, the target-side word
order is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-
side binary tree. In these node rotations, the source
binary tree instance is not considered. Imposing
a source tree on ITG (IST-ITG) constraints (Ya-
mamoto et al., 2008) is an extension of ITG con-
straints and a hybrid of the ﬁrst and second type of
approach. IST-ITG constraints directly introduce a
source sentence tree structure. Therefore, IST-ITG
can obtain stronger constraints for word reordering
than the original ITG constraints. For example, IST-
ITGconstraintsallowsonlyeightwordorderingsfor
a four-word sentence, even though twenty-two word
orderings are possible with respect to the original
ITG constraints. Although IST-ITG constraints ef-
ﬁciently suppress erroneous target word orderings,
the method cannot assign the probability to the tar-
get word orderings.
This paper presents a reordering model using syn-
tactic information of a source tree for phrase-based
statistical machine translation. The proposed re-
ordering model is an extension of IST-ITG con-
69
straints. In the proposed method, the target-side
wordorderisobtainedbyrotatingnodesofasource-
side parse-tree in a similar fashion to IST-ITG con-
straints. We modeled the rotating positions, mono-
tone or swap, from word alignments of a training
parallelcorpusandsource-sideparse-trees. Thepro-
posed method conducts a probabilistic evaluation of
target word orderings using syntactic information of
the source tree.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the previous approach to re-
solving erroneous word reordering. In Section 3,
the reordering model using syntactic information of
a source tree is presented. Section 4 shows ex-
perimental results. Finally, Section 5 presnts the
summary and some concluding remarks and future
works.
2 Previous
Works
First, we introduce two previous studies on related
word reordering constraints, ITG and IST-ITG con-
straints.
2.1 ITG
Constraints
In one-to-one word-alignment, the source word fi
is translated into the target word ei. The source
sentence [f1,f2,··· ,fN] is translated into the tar-
get sentence which is the reordered target word se-
quence [e1,e2,··· ,eN]. The number of reorderings
is N!. When ITG constraints are introduced, this
combination N! can be reduced in accordance with
the following constraints.
• Allpossiblebinarytreestructuresaregenerated
from the source word sequence.
• The target sentence is obtained by rotating any
node of the binary trees.
When N = 4, the ITG constraints can reduce
the number of combinations from 4! = 24 to
22 by rejecting the combinations [e3,e1,e4,e2]
and [e2,e4,e1,e3]. For a four-word sentence, the
search space is reduced to 92% (22/24), but for
a 10-word sentence, the search space is only 6%
(206,098/3,628,800) of the original full space.
2.2 IST-ITG Constraints
In ITG constraints, the source-side binary tree in-
stance is not considered. Therefore, if a source sen-
tence tree structure is utilized, stronger constraints
than the original ITG constraints can be created.
IST-ITG constraints directly introduce a source sen-
tence tree structure. The target sentence is obtained
with the following constraints.
• A source sentence tree structure is generated
from the source sentence.
• The target sentence is obtained by rotating any
node of the source sentence tree structure.
By parsing the source sentence, the parse-tree is
obtained. After parsing the source sentence, a
bracketed sentence is obtained by removing the
node syntactic labels; this bracketed sentence can
then be converted into a tree structure. For example,
the parse-tree “(S1 (S (NP (DT This)) (VP (AUX
is) (NP (DT a) (NN pen)))))” is obtained from the
source sentence “This is a pen,” which consists of
four words. By removing the node syntactic labels,
the bracketed sentence “((This) ((is) ((a) (pen))))”
is obtained. Such a bracketed sentence can be used
to produce constraints. If IST-ITG constraints is
applied, the number of word orderings in N = 4
is reduced to 8, down from 22 with ITG cn-
straints. For example, for the source-side bracketed
tree “((f1f2) (f3f4)),” the eight target sequences
[e1,e2,e3,e4], [e2,e1,e3,e4], [e1,e2,e4,e3],
[e2,e1,e4,e3], [e3,e4,e1,e2], [e3,e4,e2,e1],
[e4,e3,e1,e2], and [e4,e3,e2,e1] are accepted. For
the source-side bracketed tree “(((f1f2) f3) f4),”
the eight sequences [e1,e2,e3,e4], [e2,e1,e3,e4],
[e3,e1,e2,e4], [e3,e2,e1,e4], [e4,e1,e2,e3],
[e4,e2,e1,e3], [e4,e3,e1,e2], and [e4,e3,e2,e1] are
accepted. When the source sentence tree structure
is a binary tree, the number of word orderings is
reduced to 2N−1. The parsing results sometimes do
not produce binary trees. In this case, some subtrees
have more than two child nodes. For a non-binary
subtree, any reordering of child nodes is allowed. If
a subtree has three child nodes, six reorderings of
the nodes are accepted.
In phrase-based statistical machine translation, a
source “phrase” is translated into a target “phrase”.
However, with IST-ITG constraints, “word” must be
70
used for the constraint unit since the parse unit is a
“word”. To absorb different units between transla-
tion models and IST-ITG constraints, a new limita-
tion for word reordering is applied.
• Word ordering that destroys a phrase is not al-
lowed.
When this limitation is applied, the translated word
ordering is obtained from the bracketed source sen-
tence tree by reordering the nodes in the tree, which
is the same as for one-to-one word-alignment.
3 Reordering
Model Using Syntactic
Information of the Source Tree
In this section, we present a new reordering model
using syntactic information of a source-side parse-
tree.
3.1 Abstract
of Proposed Method
The IST-ITG constraints method efﬁciently sup-
presses erroneous target word orderings. However,
IST-ITG constraints cannot evaluate the accuracy of
the target word orderings; i.e., IST-ITG constraints
assign an equal probability to all target word order-
ings. This paper proposes a reordering model us-
ing syntactic information of the source tree as an
extension of IST-ITG constraints. The proposed re-
ordering model conducts a probabilistic evaluation
of target word orderings using syntactic information
of the source-side parse-tree.
In the proposed method, the target-side word or-
der is obtained by rotating nodes of the source-
side parse-tree in a similar fashion to IST-ITG con-
straints. Reordering probabilities are assigned to
each subtree of source-side parse-tree S by reorder-
ing the positions into two types: monotone and
swap. If the subtree has more than two child nodes,
the number of child node order is more than two.
However, we assume the child node order other than
monotone to be swap. The source-side parse-tree
S consists of subtrees {s1,s2,··· ,sK}, where K
is the number of subtrees included in the source-
side parse-tree. The subtree sk is which is repre-
sented by the parent node’s syntactic label and the
order, from sentence head to sentence tail, of the
child node’s syntactic labels. For example, Fig-
ure 1 shows a source-side parse-tree for a four-word

source sentence consisting of three subtrees. In Fig-
ure 1, the subtrees s1, s2, and s3 are represented by
S+NP+VP, VP+AUX+NP, and NP+DT+NN, re-
spectively. Each subtree has a probability P(t | sk),
where t is monotone (m) or swap (s). The proba-
bility of the target word reordering is calculated as
follows.
Pr =
K∏
k=1
P(t | sk) (1)
Each target candidate is assigned the different re-
ordering probability by Equation (1). Since the pro-
posed reordering model uses the syntactic labels,
which is not considered in IST-ITG constraints, the
different parse-tree assigns the different reordering
probability. The proposed model is effective for
global word reordering, because reordering proba-
bilities are also assigned to higher-level subtrees of
the source-side parse-tree.
3.2 Training
of the Proposed Model
We modeled monotone or swap node rotating auto-
matically from word alignments of a training paral-
lel corpus and source-side parse-trees. The training
algorithm for the proposed reordering model is as
follows.
1. The training process begins with a word-
aligned corpus. We obtained the word align-
ments using Koehn et al.’s method (2003),
71

alignments using the training algorithm of the proposed
model.
which is based on Och and Ney’s work (2004).
This involves running GIZA++ (Och and Ney,
2003) on the corpus in both directions, and ap-
plying reﬁnement rules (the variant they desig-
nate is “ﬁnal-and”) to obtain a single many-to-
many word alignment for each sentence.
2. Source-side parse-trees are created using a
source language phrase structure parser, which
annotates each node with a syntactic label. A
source-side parse-tree consists of several sub-
trees with syntactic labels. For example, the
parse-tree “(S1 (S (NP (DT This)) (VP (AUX
is) (NP (DT a) (NN pen)))))” is obtained from
the source sentence “This is a pen” which con-
sists of four words.
3. Word alignments and source-side parse-trees
are combined. Leaf nodes are assigned target
word positions obtained from word alignments.
Via the bottom-up process, target word posi-
tions are assigned to all nodes. For example,
in Figure 2, the left-side (sentence head) child
node of subtree s2 is assigned the target word
position “4,” and the right-side (sentence tail)
child node is assigned the target word positions
“2” and “3,” which are assigned to the child
nodes of subtree s3.
4. The monotone and swap reordering positions
are checked and counted for each subtree. By

NP+NP+PP 0.805
NP+DT+JJ+NN 0.653
NP+DT+JJ+VBP+NN 0.412
NP+DT+NN+CC+VB 0.357
Table 1: Example of proposed reordering models.
comparing the target word positions, which are
assigned in the above step, the reordering posi-
tion is determined. If the target word position
of the left-side child node is smaller than one of
the right-side child node, the reordering posi-
tion determined as monotone. For example, in
Figure 2, the subtrees s1, s2 and s3 are mono-
tone, swap, and monotone, respectively.
5. The reordering probability of the subtree can
be directly estimated by counting the reorder-
ing positions in the training data.
P(t | s) = ct(s)∑
t ct(s)
(2)
where ct(s) is the count of reordering positon t
included all training samples for the subtree s.
The parsing results sometimes do not produce bi-
nary trees. For a non-binary subtree, any reorder-
ing of child nodes is allowed. However, the pro-
posed reordering model assumes that reordering po-
sitions are only two, monotone and swap. That
is, the reordering position which the order of child
nodes do not change is monotone, and the other po-
sitions are swap. Therefore, the probability of swap
P(s | sk) is derived from the probability of mono-
tone P(m | sk) as follows.
P(s | sk) = 1.0 − P(m | sk) (3)
Table 1 shows the example of proposed reordering
models.
If a subtree is represented by a binary-tree, there
are L3 possible subtrees, where L is the number of
72

syntactic labels. However, in the possible subtrees,
there are subtrees observed only a few times in train-
ing sentences, especially when the subtree consists
of more than three child nodes. Although a large
number of subtree models can capture variations in
the training samples, too many models lead to the
over-ﬁtting problem. Therefore, subtrees where the
number of training samples is less than a heuristic
threshold and unseen subtrees are clustered to deal
with the data sparseness problem for robust model
estimations.
After creating word alignments of a training par-
allel corpus, there are target word orders which are
notderivedfromrotatingnodesofsource-sideparse-
trees. Figure 3 shows a sample which is not derived
from rotating nodes. Some are due to linguistic rea-
sons, structual differences such as negation (French
“ne...pas” and English “not”), adverb, modal and so
on. Others are due to non-linguistic reasons, er-
rors of automatic word alignments, syntactic anal-
ysis, or human translation (Fox, 2002). The pro-
posed method discards such problematic cases. In
Figure 3, the subtree s1 is then removed from train-
ing samples, and the subtrees s2 and s3 are used as
training samples.
3.3 Decoding
Using the Proposed Reordering
Model
In this section, we describe a one-pass phrase-based
decoding algorithm that uses the proposed reorder-
ing model in the decoder. The translation target sen-
tence is sequentially generated from left (sentence

phrase.
head) to right (sentence tail), and all reordering is
conducted on the source side. To introduce the pro-
posed reordering model into the decoder, the target
candidate must be checked for whether the reorder-
ing position of a subtree is either monotone or swap
whenever a new phrase is selected to extend a target
candidate. The checking algorithm is as follows.
1. For old translation candidates, the subtree s,
whichincludesbothtranslatedanduntranslated
words, and its untranslated part u are calcu-
lated.
2. When a new target phrase ¯e is generated, the
source phrase ¯f and the untranslated part u cal-
culated in the above step are compared. If the
source phrase ¯f does not include the untrans-
lated part u and is not included u, the new can-
didate is rejected.
3. In the accepted candidate, the reordering po-
sitions for all subtrees included the source side
parse-treearecheckedbycomparingthesource
phrase ¯f with the source phrase sequence used
before.

probability–monotone or swap–by the proposed re-
ordering model, and the target word order is evalu-
ated by Equation (1).
Phrase-based statistical machine translation uses
a “phrase” as the translation unit. However, the pro-
posed reordering model needs a “word” order. Be-
cause “word” alignments form the source phrase to

73
Figure 5: Example of a non-binary subtree including a

reordering position of subtree included in a phrase.
Therefore, in the decoding process using the pro-
posed reordering model, we deﬁne that higher prob-
ability, monotone or swap, are assigned to subtrees
included in a source phrase. For example, in Fig-
ure 4, the source sentence [[f1,f2],f3,f4] is trans-
lated into the target sentence [[e1,e2],e4,e3], where
[f1,f2] and [e1,e2] are used as phrases. Then, the
source phrase [f1,f2] includes the subtree s2. If the
monotone probabilities of subtrees s1, s2, and s3 are
0.8, 0.4 and 0.7, the proposed reordering probabil-
ity is 0.8 × 0.6 × 0.3 = 0.144. If a source phrase
is [f1,f2,f3,f4] and a source-side parse-tree has the
same tree structure used in Figure 4, the subtrees s1,
s2, and s3 are assigned higher reordering probabili-
ties. If the source phrase [f1,f2,f3,f4] used in Fig-
ure 4, the subtrees s1, s2, and s3 are assigned higher
reordering probabilities.
Non-binary subtrees are often observed in the
source-side parse-tree. When a source phrase ¯f is
included in a non-binary subtree and does not in-
clude a non-binary subtree, we cannot determine the
reordering position. For example, the reordering po-
sition of subtree s2 in Figure 5, which includes the
phrase [f3,f4], can not be determined. In this case,
we deﬁne that such subtrees are also to be assigned
a higher probability.
4 Experiments
To evaluate the proposed model, we conducted two
experiments: English-to-Japanese and English-to-
Chinese translation.

Translation Experiments
The ﬁrst experiment was the English-to-Japanese
(E-J) translation. Table 2 shows the training, de-
velopment and test corpus statistics. JST Japanese-
English paper abstract corpus consists of 1.0M
parallel sentences were used for model training.
This corpus was constructed from 2.0M Japanese-
English paper abstract corpus belongs to JST by
NICT using the method of Uchiyama and Isahara
(2007). For phrase-based translation model training,
we used the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003),
and 1.0M bilingual sentences. For language model
training, we used the SRI language model toolkit
(Stolcke, 2002), and 1.0M sentences for the trans-
lation model training. The language model type was
word 5-gram smoothed by Kneser-Ney discounting
(Kneser and Ney, 1995). To tune the decoder pa-
rameters, we conducted minimum error rate training
(Och, 2003) with respect to the word BLEU score
(Papineni et al., 2002) using 2.0K development sen-
tence pairs. The test set with 2.0K sentences is used.
In the evaluation and development sets, a single ref-
erence was used. For the creation of English sen-
tence parse trees and segmentation of the English,
we used the Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000). We
used Chasen for segmentation of the Japanese sen-
tences. For decoding, we used an in-house decoder
that is a close relative of the Moses decoder. The
performance of this decoder was conﬁgured to be
the same as Moses. Other conditions were the same
as the default conditions of the Moses decoder.
In this experiment, the following three methods
were compared.
• Baseline : The IBM constraints and the lexi-
cal reordering model were used for target word

reordering.
• IST-ITG : The IST-ITG constraints, the IBM
constraints, and the lexical reordering model
were used for target word reordering.
• Proposed : The proposed reordering model,
the IBM constraints, and the lexical reordering
model were used for target word reordering.
During minimum error training, each method used
each reordering model and reordering constraint.
The proposed reordering model are trained from
1.0M bilingual sentences for the translation model
training. The amount of available training samples
represented by subtrees was 9.8M. In the available
training samples, there were 54K subtree types. The
heuristic threshold was 10, and subtrees with train-
ing samples of less than 10 were clustered. The pro-
posed reordering model consisted of 5,960 subtrees
types and one clustered model “other”. The models
not including “other” covered 99.29% of all training
samples.
The BLEU scores are presented in Table 3.
In comparing “Baseline” method with “IST-ITG”
method, the improvement in BLEU was a 1.44-
point. Furthermore, in comparing “IST-ITG”
method with “Proposed” method, the improvement
in BLEU was a 0.49-point. Both the IST-ITG con-
straints and the proposed reordering model ﬁxed the
phrase position for the global reorderings. How-
ever, the proposed method can conduct a probabilis-
tic evaluation of target word reorderings which the
IST-ITG constraints cannot. Therefore, “Proposed”
method resulted in a better BLEU.

the development set. The evaluation set with 1.9K
sentences is the same as the MT08 evaluation data,
with 4 references. In this experiment, the compared
methods were the same as in the E-J experiment.
The proposed reordering model are trained from
4.6M bilingual sentences for the translation model
training. The amount of available training samples
represented by subtrees was 39.6M. In the available
training samples, there were 193K subtree types.
As in the E-J experiments, the heuristic threshold
was 10. The proposed reordering model consisted
of 18,955 subtree types and one clustered model
“other.” The models not including “other” covered
99.45% of all training samples.
The BLEU scores are presented in Table 5.
In comparing “Baseline” method with “IST-ITG”
method, the improvement in BLEU was a 1.06-
point. In comparing “IST-ITG” method with “Pro-
posed” method, the improvement in BLEU was a
0.33-point. As in the E-J experiments, “Proposed”
method performed the highest BLEU. We demon-

tiple language pairs. However, the improvement
of BLEU score in E-C translation is smaller than
the improvement in E-J translation, because English
and Chinese are similar sentence structures, such as
SVO-languages (Japanese is SOV-language). When
thesentencestructuresaredifferent,theproposedre-

5 Conclusion
This paper proposed a new word reordering model
using syntactic information of a source tree for
phrase-based statistical machine translation. The
proposed model is an extension of the IST-ITG con-
straints. In both IST-ITG constraints and the pro-
posed method, the target-side word order is obtained
by rotating nodes of the source-side tree structure.
Both the IST-ITG constraints and the proposed re-
ordering model ﬁx the phrase position for the global
reorderings. However, the proposed method can
conduct a probabilistic evaluation of target word re-
orderings which the IST-ITG constraints cannot. In
E-J and E-C translation experiments, the proposed
method resulted in a 0.49-point improvement (29.31
to 29.80) and a 0.33-point improvement (18.60 to
18.93) in word BLEU-4 compared with IST-ITG
constraints, respectively. This indicates the validity
of the proposed reordering model.
Future work will focus on a reduction of com-
putational cost of decoding including the proposed
reordering model, and a simultaneous training of
translation and reordering models. Moreover, we
will deal with difference between source and target
in multi level like in Gally et al. (2004).
The improvement could clearly be seen from vi-
sual inspection of the output, a few examples of
which are presented in the following Appendix.
