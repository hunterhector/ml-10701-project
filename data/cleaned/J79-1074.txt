INTRODUCTION In Thc plaopt;.r trt:ut~/i~:nl of ~llii~?~t i f icn t ir))t ii: or&i?~tz~vj dngrish (PTQ), Richard Montague sets up a system which uses model-theoretic semantics to provide meanings for English sentences.
Expressions of intensional logic hold a position intermediate between the English syntax and the model.
For each syntactic structure of dn English phrase there is a corresponding formula of intknsional logic.
The meaning of the English phra-se is taken to b.e the interpretation of the logical formula in the model.
In this paper, which is primarily tutdrial, we show by example how a moikel can be explicitly constructed and how a logical formula is interpreted in a model.
Our paper provides concrete examples of the semantic model and the definPtion of interpretation, given only formally by Monthgue.
It is intended to be helpful to readers of PTQ.
The reader of.
this paper may need to have a copy of PTQ hn hand.
We first review the definition.
of intensional model, and begin ta specify a model.
Then we examine the way in which meaning postulates constrain the model to be reasonable.
In a reasonable model the interpretations of Enqlish words are consistent with their usual meanings.
We select a pafticular reasonable model and use it to evaluate some formulas.
Problems in building a larger explicit model are illustrated by considering the case of adverbs..
We conclude with calculations of the size of a model and a brief discussion of the possible use of computer+ for Montague grammar.
11. INTENSIONAL MODELS An intensional mvdeL (or interprclation) a is a quintuple @ = (A, 1, J, 2, F) such that 1) A, I,,and J are non-empty sets, the set ofi entities, the set of possible worlds, and the set of moments in time, respectively.
2) < is a simple (linear) ordering on J.
3) F is the meaning function, which assigns each logical constant an appropriate element from the model.
If the constant is oE type a, the value of F ia of type <s,a).
Each element of I x J, the qet of co-ordinates, is a single point of rcj'erencc or indax.
To siwplify the notation, we use S for this cross-product.
A model then becomes a quadruple a = ( A, S, -, F).
E.6r a given A and S theset of possible denotations of type a, D is given by: a,A, 5' for simple types for complex types (the set of entities) (0 falsehood, 1 truth) (the set of total functions from S to D 1 (the set of total functions Wherk no confusion can arise, the subscripts il and S are omitted /n symbols for sets of possible denotations.
The rules for evaluatkng an expression Of the logic are given in PTQ.
An evaluation is performed with respect to a model 4, a point of reference i in S, and a variable assignment 9.
This function y assigns a denotation of the appropriate type to each variable in the expression, that is, for any variable u of type a '7 (u) E Da.
The result ofi evaluating an expression a of type a is a possible denotation of type a, i.e,,a member of D cz This value is denoted by a d, i,'t? and is called the denotation or extension of a with respect to, i, and g.
111. SPECIFYING A MODEL The first step is to give the set A of entities and the set S of points of reference.
These two sets uniquely determine for each type a each set Da of possible denotations of expressions of type a.
To complete the model, the meaning function F must be specified.
The values of F f~r constants of tgpe a are functi~ons from S to Dh.
We mow begin to build the intensional model to be used in our examples.
Because we wish to write out the sets D c7: explicitly, we construct a finite model.
While it would be po-ible td write functions explicitly in ordered pair notation, the result would be long and cumbersome, because in general the elements of the pairs are themselves functions.
We overcome this difficulty by ihtroducing names for functions and by taklng advantage of the type system of the model.
We use the type system to provide an order in which to consider the denotation sets and their elements.
The ordering is such that at each Stage the new functions can be specified as ordered pairs of names already intxduced.
The meaning function F is also specifled using these function names.
Let the set of points of reference S be 1, 121 and the set of entities, A or D, be {Jo, ~n}.
C It is important to distinguish words in the English vocabulary from conlstants in the logic front elements of the 1node1; for exfirnple, John and walk are English words, j and wtrZk' are logical constants, and Jo is gn entity, ana'element of De.
English w~rds are given in italics.
Logical constants that are direct translations of English words are ?rimed.
The function F, which defines the relafionship between constants and elements of the mod&l, assigns to each congtant of type e a function from indices to entities.
For example, for the ldgical constant j, F(j) E D = D $' where %s, &) e" In our 0, e> finite model, there are only four m~mbers of D.
and we use <s;e>,' do,al,a2,a3 as their names.
They are defined by: If E't,i)+ ==.,u2, then,i is* assigned { (7 1 L1r1) (12 JO) 1, that is, the functipn whose value at index I1 is Llh and whose value at index 72 is Yo.
Words in both of the syntactic categories CIV.and IV translate inko logical constants of type C+..u",c>., t), so the values of for these constants are functions from inaces to elements of type (<b,e?,t).
For example-, f (;cntcolvi!)* and F(r~:rZk') E 8 <6, (4~,C),t>> IT L' IS, 62")' where 0 D~ = (D &, <<s, ~>,~t?> (XS, E), t> t 1 ..

The set ofentities, A = D, is also known as the set of e individuals.
The members of the set D.
of possible .Cs, a) denotations of, type <a, a) are called individual concepts.
The members of D are functions from (<t?, L?>, t > <s3 t\ > to { 0,I], and thus a member df ? can be viewed as a st7?!

Montague's meaning postulates are restricticns on models; they limit the choices for the values of the meaning function P, that is, they constrain the possible meaning of certain English words.
Meanins Postulate 1 We 'now examine how Meaning Postulate 1 affects the choice of values of ' for constants of type e.
As an example, we consider F (,/).
Meaning Postulate 1 fbr,i is (314 U (I,) The denotation of this meaning postulate is [ (314) 0 (zc~J) ] n,i,g . This denotation must be 1 if the model is to be reasonable.
Following the recursive defiflitio,~ in PTQ [pa 2581: [ (320 n (~ikj) 1 is 1 iff there exists v E D e (D = {Jo,Unl) such that [t3(u=j)] m,i,g e is, where ' is a @assignment like 9 except that () is .u.
I O7,it,,7 I [ u (a=j)~ . is 1 if?
(u=j) is, 1, for all i E S.
Dz,itFg # 1 is 1 iff 1.1 .@,i ',a (~1= j) I is @, i ',c 1 ~1 ' is gl(:c), which fkoii~ above is v, and J is I.@., there exists v E 1) l: such that for all if E S, (i l) is %" V.
In other words, Meaning Postulate 1 requires that the value of E' for the argument,i be a constant funCtion, i .e., a function that has tk salne value at all points of.
reference. Tl~us /+' (J) cannot be just any member of.
11 < 3 y i' > ; it must be cither MGaning Postulate 2 For Meaning Postulate 2 similar analysis applies.
This meaning postulate restricts the choice of values of ' for'the constants of type (Zs, e>, t > which are translations of extensional comqon nouns.
For example, Meaning Postulate 2 for !cnicorn ' is I3 [iciiicor~i ' (x) -> (310 .c = 1 ] . A reasonable model must make it true.
Again, following the recursive definition: ( a [LO (x (314) r 5 ^u] ) 07,L:7 is 1 iff . [of () + (310 .c =' O1,i l,:~ is 1 for L1 F, A?.
(7 [unic~~rn' (x) + (3u) .c = :uJ P,i1 J' is 1 iff whenever [unico~vz ' (x) ] U'L5 i ' 9 is ' 1, then [ (3u) r = "u] m3i',9 is I.
r [unicor~z ' (3) ] J is [unicornr] 02 J i J:/ mJi ',:I [i~nicorn '1 U'zairJg is F (unico~~?~ I ) (i ) and x, IJ(7 is :7 (x).
[unicorn ' (x) ] J is [~(unicoriz') (i I)] -(g (x)).
[ (3u) x = ^u] ab,il 'O,is 1 iff there exists a v E D such e [x = Au] is 1 where 9' is a d -assignmen< like g .except that 9 ' (10 is v . [X = "II] aJi'Jar is 1 iff,-J ' is (\) t,C ' is ) and from above, I) is ;Ir) and 01,i ',g I (^ ) is the function h such that for all it' c S, For all I ' E St whenever (r) (I)] ( () is 1, then there exists v L such that 3 (s) is X*iV(v) . t The consequent of the result says that %he individual concept that is the value of (2) must be a constant function, i.e.,it must evaluate to the same entity u at every point of referbnce.
In our model, only do and a3 are constant individual concepts.
Meaning Postulate 2 restricts the possible denotations for these logical coristants of type,, t to subsets of 'the individual concepts that are constant functions.
In any reasonable model,,we must choose F so tha* that is, ;tnicorrthobd can be true only ~~~ase individual^ concepLs which yield the same entity at evdry point of reference, L We use A* as the h-operator of the metalanguage.
Thus, hxi"(v) denotes the function from S to D with the conjtant value V.
2 Meaninq
PostuLate 3 Meaning Postulate 3 restricts the choice of values of P for the constants that are translations of extensional intransitive verbs.
Meaning Postulate 3 for l~tr ik ' 'ip (3M) (Vr ) Cl [ua l ir ' (x ) ["iV] (*c) ] where M and .c are variables of type s c t and <s, n), rrespectively., A reasonable model must make this meaning postulate true.
[ (x [walk (2) ["All (%) ] ] m~i'g is 1 iff there exists an mc~ such that [ (VX) [walk1 (XI t, [V~l] 'ivr) I I Q4%,L41 4% (e, t?> is 1 where g' is a @-assignment 1ike.g except thht '(b) is m.
[ (Vx) u [waZkl.(x) t-, ["MI ("rc)I I d,i,gr is 1 iff for all x E D ds, $7 [wcr~k'(x) t, ["MI ("r)] ] m Ji3(]'' is 1 where gfl is a a-assignment like g ' except that 9".
(x) is x.
m,i,g 11, [a [wiz2k'(c) e ['MI (vr)]] 1s 1 iff Y [I ' (x) ['MI ("x)] 0Z3i'3g" is 1 iff [walkr (s)] O1,i rJglt Q,i'Ji?"[,)az>il~, 11 I~aZic' (x) 1 oLi',g" is [walk,j which is [E(waikl) (it)] (gl'(x)) which is [F(walkf) (if)] (x); which is [M, ir UL '~9.~~ (-,i 1 )$) which is [gU(M) (i I)] (g" fx) (i ') ) which is [p71([t)] (\(!'I).
Thus the meaning pos4tulate is.
true just in case there csists 1 vil E L such that for a11 \ i,?
(c:,t3,, (: (i ')I (i) {SJ kt*, 0) I is [(I ((I' for all : Z :: Thus, dcpen~is only on the cntity and thc point of reference.
If : *+ t is true at a " t point.
of reference for an individual concept, then' *A:: i is true at that point sf reference for every individual concept that gives the same entity at that point of reference.
Relating this to our model, we see that since aO(T1) = it1 (11) and LuZ(lI) = nj(ll), a (12) = a2 [I)? and 0 (I:) = i13 (12) Meanipg Postulate 3 requires: Thus, tre must choose F so that V, USING a MODEL We now explicitly construct a particular reasonable model in which tc evalqate some formulas.
It must satisfy the constraints on F developed above.
We assign to,the constant j the entity Jo at all points of reference: F (if = eo = (11 JO) (12 SO)}.
We s.tipul'ate that there are no unicorns at point 0% reference 75 and one unicorn, entity Un, at point of reference 12: P (u~~ie~rn') = { (1 l a,) (12 8,)) = { (11 { (aO 0) (al 0) (a2 0) (a3 0))) At pgint of reference 7 entities Jo and Un walk and at point of reference 12, only 30 walks: Our first etraLuation u'sing this model w141 be for the expression which is,the translation of John: Finding the..
denotation of.
this expression: 'AP ["PI (rd I '~'~'9 is A function h j* such that h (p) is I j* [ ["PI (^j) la' where g ' is a -assignment like g exoept that is p+ whikh is [P 0Z3i9g' (i)] (h+iI[j which is [gl(P) (it)] (X*il[F(j) (i')]) which is [p (i)] (F(j)).
Thus, the expression denotes the function ii .* = X*p [ [p (i) ] (F (j) ) ] J So hj, is the set of properties which, when evaluated at point of reference i, are true of the individual .concept that is the value of F for j.
In this example of a reasonable model, P (,j) is no and the possible denotations, p (i), for which ro gets true are B8 through fils.
At point of reference TI, the value of the function which is the denotation of the expression that translates John is 1 for the arguments {(TI )(I2 f3 )} wherem > 8 m n and at point of reference 12, it is 1 for the arguments { (11 f3 ) (12 f3 )I where n > 8.
m n 7 Now, we evaluate the direct tralslation of the sentence At point of reference 11, the denotation of this expression is: up [ Vpl I &,lLg ("walk ' ) f1311,i7 [XP[~PI (Aj)] ~~''~g,~(uc~k~) The model can be also used LG illastrate the general fact that the d'enotations of an expression and any of its reductions are the same.
We have shown elsewhere [Friedman, 19781 that each expression of the logic has a unique reduced form in which no further contractioh is possible.
We now evaluate the reduced form of the trahsldtion of John walks, [walk '.("j) ] . At point of r.eference t! : As another example, consider the logical expression [AP ["PI j) ] ("unicorn I).
Evaluating in world I1 ['PI (^j 1 " 1 ' (F (unicorn ' ) ) The reduced form of the expression is unicornr(^j).
Evaluating in world IT [unicorn ' (" j) ] mI7,g [I (a, 0) (al 0) (a2 0) (9 0131 (ao) Vim THE MORE COMPLEX CASE OF ADVERBS We now consider extending our model to accommodate sentences with adverbs Such* as s 1~1dZy.
"We have that F(szor~Lg ') E D + 0, (Ls, 3 t, t, as, C?, t>?> There are not only too many possible denot'aations to consider enumerating them, but in each possible denotation, there are.too many components to consider fully specifying it (see below) . Consequently, in this example, only that portion of F (s Zoz~Zy ' ) which is needed will be specified.
The denotation for the sentence Joh?~ w~zzks slot~Zt~ is: [~F(sZOZ~ZZJ') (i)] (P(~~zlii'))] (F(j)) At point of reference 11, Jo and UII are both walking, and choosiqg that JO is walking slowly: and VIT.
SIZE OF A MODEL The smallest interesting model for PTQ has two points of reference and two entities.
For such a model, the size of the sets of possible denotrjtions and the size of their elements (in ordered pair representetion) are as given in the following table.
Nw~ber of Ordered Pairs in Possible Denotation Number of Podsible .Set of possible Denotations Denotations These size computatiops have relevance to a possible computer implementation.
For a typicai large-scale computer, the number of addressable memory locations is on the order of 224 (about 16 million), yet 9 of the 16 sets of possible denotations have more inembers than this.
This means that a full model cannot be explicitly represented in a computes.
However) in evaluating expressions only some of the possible denotations are actually used.
I~nplernentation on a cpmputes might allow a partial specification of a model, with only those possible denotations that are actually denoted by the expressiohs considered.
In this context it is also interesting to note that the number of neurons in thelhuman brain is currently estipated to be about 2" (10 billion).
We have explicitly constructed an intensional model to illustrate the basic notions of the model-theoretic semantics of PTQ.
We showed how the meaning postulates constrain the model to be reasonable and evaluated some simple formulas.
The number of possible denotations in a small model was shown to present a problem to be solved if explicit representations of models are to be used.
This problem is discussed further in Friedman, Moran, an& Warren 119781.

lint and @aboutt) ar2 translated into logical constants of type: f (IA V/Tg) = <<s,<<s,<Xs,e>, t >>, t>>,<<~,<<s,e>~t>>,<<s,e>, t>>> To facilitate interaction? the system uses new type names that are mean iny ful, simple, and easily distinguished from each other.
The conventiou is to use the names of the syntactic categofries as names for the corresponding semantic typez, i.e., for syntactic category x, the name of the correspondinq type, f (x), will also be x.
This can be done here without confusion becaose the syntactic categcrias do not play any pa~t in this svstem.
Where PTQ uses special symbols, e.g., iV, IV, for the cogpound syntactic catqories, 5/@, -,V/TZ, we also use these special symbols, Flpwaver, there are types that ja not corcesponil to syntactic cat~.qories, e.rl., the types fat the intensions of the typed that corraspond to syntactic catoqories; the name ue use for one of those is the corflhi~~ation of the names forits component types, u.

It is Also possible for the argument of a LAMBDA-expression to be anoth~r &~EA-ex~c~'ssion.
5eaningf ul expressions of both these forms are qene~dtet in PTC* Furthermore, even where this simplification is applicable, this simplification is a syntactic reduction an5 ahauld be performed before the expression is interpreted.
