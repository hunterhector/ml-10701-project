Abstract
Thispaperfocusesonthechangeofnamed
entities over time and its influence on the
performance of the named entity tagger.
First, we analyze Japanese named enti-
ties which appear in Mainichi Newspaper
articles published in 1995, 1996, 1997,
1998 and 2005. This analysis reveals that
the number of named entity types and
the number of named entity tokens are
almost steady over time and that 70 ∼
80% of named entity types in a certain
year occur in the articles published either
in its succeeding year or in its preceding
year. These facts lead that 20 ∼ 30%
of named entity types are replaced with
new ones every year. The experiment
against these texts shows that our propos-
ing semi-supervised method which com-
bines a small annotated corpus and a large
unannotated corpus for training works ro-
bustly although the traditional supervised
method is fragile against the change of
name entity distribution.
1 Introduction
It is widely agreed that extraction of named entity
(henceforth, denoted as NE) is an important sub-
task for various NLP applications, such as infor-
mation retrieval, machine translation, information
extraction and natural language understanding.
Several conferences like Message Understanding
Conference(Grishman and Sundheim, 1996) and
the IREX workshop (Sekine and Eriguchi, 2000)
were conducted to encourage researchers of NE
extraction and to provide its common evaluation
basis.
In Japanese NE extraction, it is quite common
to apply morphological analysis as preprocessing
stage which segments a sentence into a sequence
of morphemes. After that, either a pattern matcher
based on hand-crafted rules or a statistical chun-
ker is employed to extract NEs from a sequence of
morphemes. Variousmachinelearningapproaches
such as maximum entropy(Uchimoto et al., 2000),
decision list(Sassano and Utsuro, 2000; Isozaki,
2001), and Support Vector Machine(Yamada et
al., 2002; Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002) were in-
vestigated for extracting NEs. These researches
show that machine learning approaches are more
promising than approaches based on hand-crafted
rules if a large corpus whose NEs are properly an-
notated is available as training data.
However, it is difficult to obtain an enough cor-
pus in the real world because of the increasing
number of NE types and the increasing time gap
between the training corpus and the test corpus.
There is the increasing number of NE types like
personal names and company names in the real
world. For example, a large database of organi-
zation names(Nichigai Associates, 2007) already
contains 171,708 types and is still increasing. Be-
cause annotation work is quite expensive, the an-
notated corpus may become obsolete in a short
period of time. Both of two factors expands the
difference of NE distribution between the training
corpus and the test corpus, and it may decrease the
performance of the NE tagger as shown in (Mota
and Grishman, 2008). Therefore, a robust method
to extract NEs which do not occur or occur few
times in a training corpus is necessary.
This paper focuses on the change of NEs over
time and its influence on the performance of the
NE tagger. First, we annotate NEs in Mainichi
Newspaper articles published in 1996, 1997, 1998
and 2005, and analyze NEs which appear in
these texts and an existing corpus. It consists of
Mainichi Newspaper articles published in 1995,
thus, we get an annotated corpus that spans 10
years. This analysis reveals that the number of
NE types and the number of NE tokens are almost

The experiment against these corpora shows that
the traditional supervised method is fragile against
the change of NE types and that our proposing
semi-supervised method which combines a small
annotated corpus and a large unannotated corpus
for training is robust against the change of NE
types.

of Changing Named Entities
2.1 Task
of the IREX Workshop
The task of NE extraction of the IREX work-
shop (Sekine and Eriguchi, 2000) is to recognize
eight NE categories in Table 1. The organizer
of the IREX workshop provided a training corpus
(henceforth, denoted as IREX corpus), which con-
sists of 1,174 Mainichi Newspaper articles pub-
lished from January 1st 1995 to 10th which in-
clude 18,677 NEs. In the Japanese language, no
other corpora whose NEs are annotated are pub-
licly available as far as we know.1 Thus, IREX
corpus is referred as a golden sample of NE distri-
bution in this paper.
2.2 Data
Description
The most homogeneous texts which are written in
different days are desirable, to explore the influ-
enceofthetexttimeframeonNEdistribution. Be-
cause IREX corpus is referred as a golden sample
1The organizer of the IREX workshop also provides the
testing data to its participants, however, we cannot see it be-
cause we did not join it.

Figure 2: Overlap ratio of NEs over years
in this paper, Mainichi Newspaper articles writ-
ten in different years than IREX corpus is suit-
able. Thus, ordinal days of June and October in
1996, 1997, 1998 and 2005 are randomly selected
as sampling days.
Because annotating work is too expensive for
us to annotate all articles published in sampling
days, thirty percent of them are only annotated.
Each article of Mainichi Newspaper belongs into
16 categories like front page articles, international
stories, economical stories, political stories, edito-
rial columns, and human interest stories. Because
these categories may influence to NE distribution,
it is important to keep the proportion of categories
in the sampled texts to the proportion in the whole
newspaper, in order to investigate NE distribution
over the whole newspaper. Therefore, thirty per-
cent articles of each category published at sam-
pling days are randomly selected and annotated in
accordance with the IREX regulation.

sponding to IREX corpus, and other columns are
corresponding to articles annotated by ourselves.
Table 2 illustrates that the normalized number of
NEtypesandthenormalizednumberofNEtokens
are almost steady over time. Figure 1 shows the
distributions of NE categories for sampling texts
and that there is no significant difference between
them.
We also investigate the relation of the time gap
between texts and NE types which appear in these
texts. The overlap ratio of NE types between the
annotated corpus A published in the year YA and
the annotated corpus B published in the year YB
was defined in (Mota and Grishman, 2008) as fol-
lows
type overlap(A,B) = |TA ∩TB||T
A|+|TB|−|TA ∩TB|,
where TA and TB are lists of NE types which ap-
pear in A and B respectively. However, it is im-
possible to compute reliable type overlap in our
research because enough annotated texts are un-
available. As an alternative of type overlap, the
overlap ratio of NE types between the annotated
corpus A and the unannotated corpus U published
in the year YU is defined as follows
string overlap(A,U) =
∑
s∈TA δ(s,U)
|TA| ,
where δ(s,U) is the binary function to indicate
whether the string s occurs in the string U or not.
Table 3 shows string ratio values of annotated
texts. It shows that 70 ∼ 80% of TA appear in the
preceding year of YA, and that 70 ∼ 80% of TA
appear in the succeeding year of YA.
Figure 2 shows the relation between the time
gap YU − YA and string ratio(A,U). Sup-
pose that all NEs are independent and equiv-
alent on their occurrence probability and that
string ratio(A,U) is equal to 0.8 when the time
gap YU − YA is equal to one. When the time gap
YUprime − YA is equal to two years, although this as-
sumption leads that string ratio(A,Uprime) will be
equal to 0.64, string ratio(A,Uprime) in Figure 2 is
greater than 0.7. This suggests that NEs are not
equivalent on their occurrence probability. And
more, Table 4 shows that the longer time span
of the annotated text increases the number of NE
types. These facts lead that some NEs are short-
lived and superseded by other new NEs.
3 Robust
Extraction of Changing Named
Entities
It is infeasible to prepare a large annotated cor-
pus which covers all increasing NEs. A semi-
supervised learning approach which combines a
small annotated corpus and a large unannotated
corpus for training is promising to cope this prob-
lem. (Miller et al., 2004) proposed the method
using classes which are assigned to words based
on the class language model built from a large
unannotated corpus. (Ando and Zhang, 2005) pro-

posed the method using thousands of automati-
cally generated auxiliary classification problems
on an unannotated corpus. (?) proposed the semi-
supervised discriminative model whose potential
function can treat both an annotated corpus and an
unannotated corpus.
Inthispaper,themethodproposedby(Tsuchiya
et al., 2008) is employed, because its implementa-
tion is quite easy. It consists of two steps. The
first step is to assign the most similar and famil-
iar morpheme to each unfamiliar morpheme based
on their context vectors calculated from a large
unannotated corpus. The second step is to employ
Conditional Random Fields(CRF)2(Lafferty et al.,
2001) using both features of original morphemes
and features of similar morphemes.
This section gives the detail of this method.
3.1 Chunking
of Named Entities
It is quite common that the task of extracting
Japanese NEs from a sentence is formalized as
a chunking problem against a sequence of mor-
phemes. For representing proper chunks, we em-
ploy IOB2 representation, one of representations
which have been studied well in various chunking
2http://chasen.org/˜taku/software/CRF+
+/
tasks of NLP (Tjong Kim Sang, 1999). This rep-
resentation uses the following three labels.
B Current token is the beginning of a chunk.
I Current token is a middle or the end of a
chunk consisting of more than one token.
O Current token is outside of any chunk.
Actually, we prepare the 16 derived labels from
the label B and the label I for eight NE categories,
in order to distinguish them.
When the task of extracting Japanese NEs from
a sentence is formalized as a chunking problem
of a sequence of morphemes, the segmentation
boundary problem arises as widely known. For
example, the NE definition of IREX tells that a
Chinese character “ (bei)” must be extracted as
an NE means America from a morpheme “Z
(hou-bei)” which means visiting America. A naive
chunkerusingamorphemeasachunkingunitcan-
not extract such a kind of NEs. In order to cope
this problem, (Uchimoto et al., 2000) proposed
employing translation rules to modify problematic
morphemes, and (Asahara and Matsumoto, 2003;
NakanoandHirai,2004)formalizedthetaskofex-
tracting NEs as a chunking problem of a sequence
of characters instead of a sequence of morphemes.
In this paper, we keep the naive formalization, be-
cause it is still enough to analyze the influence of
164
the text time frame.
3.2 Assignment
of Similar Morpheme
A context vector Vm of a morpheme m is a vector
consisting of frequencies of all possible unigrams
and bigrams,
Vm =



f(m,m0), ··· f(m,mN),
f(m,m0,m0), ··· f(m,mN,mN),
f(m0,m), ··· f(mN,m),
f(m0,m0,m), ··· f(mN,mN,m)


,
where M ≡ {m0,m1,...,mN} is a set of all
morphemes of the unannotated corpus, f(mi,mj)
is a frequency that a sequence of a morpheme mi
and a morpheme mj occurs in the unannotated
corpus, and f(mi,mj,mk) is a frequency that a
sequence of morphemes mi,mj and mk occurs in
the unannotated corpus.
Suppose an unfamiliar morpheme mu ∈ M ∩
MF, where MF is a set of familiar morphemes
that occur frequently in the annotated corpus. The
most similar morpheme ˆmu to the morpheme mu
measuredwiththeircontextvectorsisgivenbythe
following equation,
ˆmu = argmax
m∈MF
sim(Vmu,Vm), (1)
wheresim(Vi,Vj)isasimilarityfunctionbetween
context vectors. In this paper, the cosine function
is employed as it.
3.3 Features
The feature set Fi at i-th position is defined as
a tuple of the morpheme feature MF(mi) of the
i-th morpheme mi, the similar morpheme feature
SF(mi), and the character type feature CF(mi).
Fi = 〈 MF(mi), SF(mi), CF(mi) 〉
The morpheme feature MF(mi) is a pair of the
surface string and the part-of-speech of mi. The
similar morpheme feature SF(mi) is defined as
SF(mi) =
{ MF( ˆm
i) if mi ∈ M ∩MF
MF(mi) otherwise ,
where ˆmi is the most similar and familiar mor-
pheme to mi given by Eqn. 1. The character type
feature CF(mi) is a set of six binary flags to in-
dicate that the surface string of mi contains a Chi-
nese character, a hiragana character, a katakana

When we identify the chunk label ci for the i-
th morpheme mi, the surrounding five feature sets
Fi−2,Fi−1,Fi,Fi+1,Fi+2 and the preceding two
chunk labels ci−2,ci−1 are referred as shown in
Figure 4.
Figure 3 shows an example of training instance
of the proposed method for the sentence “�

t	 (Ishikari) � (heiya) w (no)
1> (tenki) x (ha)

is fine at Ishikari-plain, today”. “f (Kantou)”
is assigned as the most similar and familiar mor-
pheme to “
t	 (Ishikari)” which is unfamiliar in
the training corpus.
3.4 Experimental
Result
Figure 5 compares performances of the proposed
method and the baseline method over the test texts
which were published in 1996, 1997, 1998 and
2005. The proposed method combines a small an-
notated corpus and a large unannotated corpus as
already described. This experiment refers IREX
corpus as a small annotated corpus, and refers
Mainichi Newspaper articles published from 1993
to the preceding year of the test text published
year as a large unannotated corpus. For example,
whenthetesttextwaspublishedin1998, Mainichi
Newspaper articles published from 1993 to 1997
are used. The baseline method is trained from
IREX corpus with CRF. But, it uses only MF and
CF as features, and does not use SF. Figure 5 il-
lustrates two points: (1) the proposed method out-
performs the baseline method consistently, (2) the
baselinemethodisfragiletochangingoftesttexts.
Figure 6 shows the relation between the per-
formance of the proposed method and the size of
unannotated corpus against the test corpus pub-
lished in 2005. It reveals that that increasing unan-
notated corpus size improves the performance of
the proposed method.

formance of the NE tagger. First, we annotated
Mainichi Newspaper articles published in 1996,
1997, 1998 and 2005, and analyzed NEs which
appear in these texts and IREX corpus which con-
sists of Mainichi Newspaper articles published in
1995. This analysis illustrated that the number of
NE types and the number of NE tokens are al-
most steady over time, and that 70 ∼ 80% of NE
types seen in a certain year occur in the texts pub-
lished either in its succeeding year or in its pre-
ceding year. The experiment against these texts
showed that our proposing semi-supervised NE
tagger works robustly although the traditional su-
pervised NE tagger is fragile against the change of
NE types. Based on the results described in this
paper, we will investigate the relation between the
performance of NE tagger and the similarity of its
training corpus and its test corpus.
