1.Introduction
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task ofidentifying the correct sense ofan
ambiguous word in a given context. An accurate WSD system would beneﬁt appli-
cations such as machine translation and information retrieval. The most successful
WSD systems to date are based on supervised learning and trained on sense-tagged
corpora. In this article we present an unsupervised WSD algorithm that can leverage
untagged text and can perform at the level of the best supervised systems for the all-
nouns disambiguation task.
The main drawback ofthe supervised approach is the difﬁculty ofacquiring
considerable amounts oftraining data, also known as the knowledge acquisition
bottleneck. Yarowsky and Florian (2002) report that each successive doubling ofthe
training data for WSD only leads to a 3–4% error reduction within their experimental
range. Banko and Brill (2001) experiment with the problem ofselection among
confusable words and show that the learning curves do not converge even after

a billion words oftraining data. They suggest unsupervised, semi-supervised, or
active learning to take advantage oflarge data sets when labeling is expensive. Yuret
(2004) observes that in a supervised naive Bayes WSD system trained on SemCor,
approximately halfofthe test instances do not contain any ofthe contextual features
(e.g., neighboring content words or local collocation patterns) observed in the training
data. SemCor is the largest publicly available corpus ofsense-tagged text, and has only
about a quarter million sense-tagged words. In contrast, our unsupervised system uses
the Web1T data set (Brants and Franz 2006) for unlabeled examples, which contains
counts from a 10
12
word corpus derived from publicly-available Web pages.
A note on the term “unsupervised” may be appropriate here. In the WSD literature
“unsupervised” is typically used to describe systems that do not directly use sense-
tagged corpora for training. However, many of these unsupervised systems, including
ours, use sense ordering or sense frequencies from WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) or other
dictionaries. Thus it might be more appropriate to call them weakly supervised or
semi-supervised. More speciﬁcally, context–sense pairs or context–word–sense triples
are not observed in the training data, but context-word frequencies (from untagged
text) and word-sense frequencies (from dictionaries or other sources) are used in model
building. One ofthe main problems we explore in this study is the estimation ofcontext-
dependent sense probabilities when no context–sense pairs have been observed in the
training data.
The ﬁrst contribution ofthis article is a probabilistic generative model for word
sense disambiguation that seamlessly integrates unlabeled text data into the model
building process. Our approach is based on the noisy channel model (Shannon 1948),
which has been an essential ingredient in ﬁelds such as speech recognition and machine
translation. In this study we demonstrate that the noisy channel model can also be the
key component for unsupervised word sense disambiguation, provided we can solve
the context-dependent sense distribution problem. In Section 2.1 we show one way
to estimate the context-dependent sense distribution without using any sense-tagged
data. Section 2.2 outlines the complete unsupervised WSD algorithm using this model.
We estimate the distribution ofcoarse-grained semantic classes rather than ﬁne-grained
senses. The solution uses the two distributions for which we do have data: the distribu-
tion ofwords used to express a given sense, and the distribution ofwords that appear
in a given context. The ﬁrst can be estimated using WordNet sense frequencies, and the
second can be estimated using ann-gram language model as described in Section 2.3.
The second contribution ofthis article is an exploration ofsemantic classes at differ-
ent levels of granularity for word sense disambiguation. Using ﬁne-grained senses for
model building is inefﬁcient both computationally and from a learning perspective. The
noisy channel model can take advantage ofthe close distribution ofsimilar senses ifthey
are grouped into semantic classes. We take semantic classes to be groups ofWordNet
synsets deﬁned using the hypernym hierarchy. In each experiment we designate a
number ofsynsets high in the WordNet hypernym hierarchy as “head synsets” and
use their descendants to partition the senses into separate semantic classes. In Section 3
we present performance bounds for such class-based WSD and describe our method of
exploring the different levels of granularity.
In Section 4 we report on our actual experiments and compare our results with
the best supervised and unsupervised systems from SensEval-2 (Cotton et al. 2001),
SensEval-3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004), and SemEval-2007 (Agirre, M`arquez, and
Wicentowski 2007). Section 5 discusses these results and the idiosyncrasies ofthe
data sets, baselines, and evaluation metrics used. Section 6 presents related work, and
Section 7 summarizes our contributions.

2.TheNoisyChannelModelforWSD
2.1Model
The noisy channel model has been the foundation of standard models in speech recog-
nition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983) and machine translation (Brown et al. 1990).
In this article we explore its application to WSD. The noisy channel model can be
used whenever a signal received does not uniquely identify the message being sent.
Bayes’ Law is used to interpret the ambiguous signal and identify the most probable
intended message. In WSD, we model each context as a distinct channel where the
intended message is a word sense (or semantic class) S, and the signal received is an
ambiguous wordW. In this section we will describe how to model a given contextCas
a noisy channel, and in particular how to estimate the context-speciﬁc sense distribution
without using any sense-tagged data.
Equation (1) expresses the probability ofa sense Sofword W in a given contextC.
This is the well-known Bayes’ formula with an extra P(.|C) in each term indicating the
dependence on the context.
P(S|W,C) =
P(W|S,C)P(S|C)
P(W|C)
(1)
To perform WSD we need to ﬁnd the senseSthat maximizes the probability P(S|W,C).
This is equivalent to the maximization ofthe product P( W|S,C)P(S|C) because the
denominator P(W|C) does not depend on S. To perform the maximization, the two
distributions P(W|S,C)andP(S|C) need to be estimated for each contextC.
The main challenge is to estimate P(S|C), the distribution ofword senses that can
be expressed in the given context. In unsupervised WSD we do not have access to any
sense-tagged data, thus we do not know what senses are likely to be expressed in any
given context. Therefore it is not possible to estimate P(S|C)directly.
What we do have is the word frequencies for each sense P(W|S), and the word
frequencies for the given context P(W|C). We use the WordNet sense frequencies to
estimate P(W|S) and a statistical language model to estimate P(W|C) as detailed in
Section 2.3. We make the independence assumption P(W|S,C) = P(W|S), that is, the
distribution ofwords used to express a particular sense is the same for all contexts.
Finally, the relationship between the three distributions, P(S|C), P(W|S,C), and P(W|C)
is given by the total probability theorem:
P(W|C) =
summationdisplay
S
P(S|C)P(W|S,C)(2)
We can solve for P(S|C) using linear algebra. Let WS be a matrix, s and w two vectors
such that:
WS
ij
= P(W=i|S=j)
s
j
= P(S=j|C=k)
w
i
= P(W=i|C=k)(3)
113
Computational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 1
Using this new form, we can see that Equation (2) is equivalent to the linear equation
w=WS×sandscan be solved using a linear solver. Typically WS is a tall matrix and
the system has no exact solutions. We use the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse WS
+
to
compute an approximate solution:
s=WS
+
×w (4)
Appendix A discusses possible scaling issues ofthis solution and ofers alternative
solutions. We use the pseudoinverse solution in all our experiments because it can be
computed fast and none of the alternatives we tried made a signiﬁcant difference in
WSD performance.
2.2Algorithm
Section 2.1 described how to apply the noisy channel model for WSD in a single context.
In this section we present the steps we follow in our experiments to simultaneously
apply the noisy channel model to all the contexts in a given word sense disambiguation
task.
Algorithm 1
1. Let W be the vocabulary. In this study we took the vocabulary to be the
approximately 12,000 nouns in WordNet that have non-zero sense
frequencies.
2. Let S be the set ofsenses or semantic classes to be used. In this study we
used various partitions ofnoun synsets as semantic classes.
3. Let C be the set ofcontexts (nine-word windows for a 5-gram model)
surrounding each target word in the given WSD task.
4. Compute the matrix WC where WC
ik
= P(W=i|C=k). Hereiranges
over the vocabulary W andkranges over the contexts C. This matrix
concatenates the (w) word distribution vectors from Equation (4) for each
context. The entries ofthe matrix are computed using the n-gram language
model described in Section 2.3. This is the most expensive step in the
algorithm (see Appendix B for a discussion of implementation efﬁciency).
5. Compute the matrix WS where WS
ij
= P(W=i|S=j). Hereiranges over
the vocabulary W andjranges over the semantic classes S. The entries of
the matrix are computed using the WordNet sense frequencies.
6. Compute the matrix SC=WS
+
×WC where SC
jk
= P(S=j|C=k).
Herejranges over the semantic classes S andkranges over the contexts C.
This step computes the pseudoinverse solution described in Section 2.1
simultaneously for all the contexts, and the resulting SC matrix is a
concatenation ofthe (s) solution vectors from Equation (4) for each context.
WS
+
is the pseudoinverse ofthe matrix WS.
7. Compute the best semantic class for each WSD instance by using
argmax
S
P(S|W,C) ∝ P(W|S)P(S|C). Here P(S|C) comes from the column
ofthe SC matrix that corresponds to the context ofthe WSD instance
114
Yuret and Yatbaz The Noisy Channel Model for Unsupervised WSD
and P(W|S) comes from the row of the WS matrix that corresponds to the
word to be disambiguated.
8. Compute the ﬁne-grained answer for each WSD instance by taking the
most frequent (lowest numbered) sense in the chosen semantic class.
9. Apply the onesenseperdiscourse heuristic: Ifa word is found to have
multiple senses in a document, replace them with the majority answer.
2.3EstimationProcedure
In Section 2.1, we showed how the unsupervised WSD problem expressed as a noisy
channel model can be decomposed into the estimation oftwo distributions: P(W|S)and
P(W|C). In this section we detail our estimation procedure for these two distributions.
To estimate P(W|S), the distribution ofwords that can be used to express a given
meaning, we used the WordNet sense frequencies.
1
We did not perform any smoothing
for the zero counts and used the maximum likelihood estimate: count(W,S)/count(S).
As described in later sections, we also experimented with grouping similar WordNet
senses into semantic classes. In this caseSstands for the semantic class, and the counts
from various senses of a word in the same semantic class are added together to estimate
P(W|S).
To estimate the distribution ofwords in a given context, P(W|C), we used a 5-gram
language model. We deﬁne the context as the nine-word window centered on the target
wordw

expressed as:

Equation (5) indicates that P(W|C) is proportional to P(w

) because the other
words in the context are ﬁxed for a given WSD instance. Equation (6) is the standard
decomposition ofthe probability ofa word sequence into conditional probabilities.
The ﬁrst four terms do not include the target wordw
5, and have been dropped in Equa-
tion (7). We also truncate the remaining conditionals to four words reﬂecting the Markov
assumption ofthe 5-gram model. Finally, using an expression that is proportional to
P(W|C) instead ofP( W|C) itselfwill not change the WSD result because we are taking
theargmaxinEquation(1).
Each term on the right hand side ofEquation (7) is estimated using a 5-gram
language model. To get accurate domain-independent probability estimates we used the
Web 1T data set (Brants and Franz 2006), which contains the counts ofword sequences
up to length ﬁve in a 10
12
word corpus derived from publicly-accessible Web pages.
Estimation ofP(W|C) is the most computationally expensive step ofthe algorithm, and
some implementation details are given in Appendix B.
1 The
sense frequencies were obtained from the index.sense ﬁle included in the WordNet distribution.
We had to correct the counts ofthree words (person,group,andlocation) whose WordNet counts
unfortunately include the corresponding named entities and are thus inﬂated.

3.SemanticClasses
Our algorithm internally differentiates semantic classes rather than ﬁne-grained senses.
Using ﬁne-grained senses in the noisy channel model would be computationally ex-
pensive because the word–sense matrix needs to be inverted (see Equation [4]). It is
also unclear whether using ﬁne-grained senses for model building will lead to better
learning performance: The similarity between the distributions of related senses is
ignored and the data becomes unnecessarily fragmented.
Even though we use coarse-grained semantic classes for model building, we use
ﬁne-grained senses for evaluation. During evaluation, the coarse-grained semantic
classes predicted by the model are mapped to ﬁne-grained senses by picking the lowest
numbered WordNet sense in the chosen semantic class.
2
This is necessary to perform a
meaningful comparison with published results.
We take semantic classes to be groups ofWordNet synsets deﬁned using the hyper-
nym hierarchy (see Section 6 for alternative deﬁnitions). Section 4 presents three WSD
experiments using different sets of semantic classes at different levels of granularity.
In each experiment we designate a number ofsynsets high in the WordNet hypernym
hierarchy as “head synsets” and use their descendants to form the separate semantic
classes.
An arbitrary set ofhead synsets will not necessarily have mutually exclusive and
collectively exhaustive descendants. To assign every synset to a unique semantic class,
we impose an ordering on the semantic classes. Each synset is assigned only to the ﬁrst
semantic class whose head it is a descendant ofaccording to this ordering. Ifthere are
synsets that are not descendants ofany ofthe heads, they are collected into a separate
semantic class created for that purpose.
Using the coarse-grained semantic classes for prediction, Algorithm 1 will be unable
to return the correct ﬁne-grained sense when this is not the lowest numbered sense in
a semantic class. To quantify the restrictive effect of working with a small number of
semantic classes, Figure 1 plots the number ofsemantic classes versus the best possible
2 The
sense numbers are ordered by the frequency of occurrence in WordNet.
116

oracle accuracy for the nouns in the SemCor corpus. To compute the oracle accuracy, we
assume that the program can ﬁnd the correct semantic class for each instance, but has to
pick the ﬁrst sense in that class as the answer. To construct a given number ofsemantic
classes, we used the following algorithm:
Algorithm 2
1. Initialize all synsets to be in a single “default” semantic class.
2. For each synset, compute the following score: the oracle accuracy achieved
ifthat synset and all its descendants are split into a new semantic class.
3. Take the synset with the highest score and split that synset and its
descendants into a new semantic class.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired number ofsemantic classes is
achieved.
The upper bound on ﬁne-grained accuracy given a small number ofsemantic
classes is surprisingly high. In particular, the best reported noun WSD accuracy (78%)
is achievable ifwe could perfectly distinguish between ﬁve semantic classes.
4.ThreeExperiments
We ran three experiments with the noisy channel model using different sets of semantic
classes. The ﬁrst experiment uses the 25 WordNet semantic categories for nouns, the
second experiment looks at what happens when we group all the senses to just two
or three semantic classes, and the ﬁnal experiment optimizes the number ofsemantic
classes using one data set (which gives 135 classes) and reports the out-of-sample result
using another data set.
The noun instances from the last three SensEval/SemEval English all-words tasks
are used for evaluation. We focus on the disambiguation of nouns for several reasons.
Nouns constitute the largest portion ofcontent words (48% ofthe content words in the
Brown corpus [Kucera and Francis 1967] are nouns). For many tasks and applications
(e.g., Web queries [Jansen, Spink, and Pfaff 2000]) nouns are the most frequently encoun-
tered and important part ofspeech. Finally, WordNet has a more complete coverage
ofnoun semantic relations than other parts ofspeech, which is important for our
experiments with semantic classes.
As described in Section 2.2 we use the model to assign each ambiguous word to its
most likely semantic class in all the experiments. The lowest numbered sense in that
class is taken as the ﬁne-grained answer. Finally we apply the onesenseperdiscourse
heuristic: Ifthe same word has been assigned more than one sense within the same
document, we take a majority vote and use sense numbers to break the ties.
Table 1 gives some baselines for comparison. The performance of the best super-
vised and unsupervised systems on noun disambiguation for each data set are given.
The ﬁrst-sense baseline (FSB) is obtained by always picking the lowest numbered sense
for the word in the appropriate WordNet version. We prefer the FSB baseline over the
commonly used most-frequent-sense baseline because the tie breaking is unambiguous.
All the results reported are for ﬁne-grained sense disambiguation. The top three systems
given in the table for each task are all supervised systems; the result for the best

4.1FirstExperiment:The25WordNetCategories
In previous work, descendants of25 special WordNet synsets (known as the unique
beginners) have been used as the coarse-grained semantic classes for nouns (Crestan,
El-B`eze, and De Loupy 2001; Kohomban and Lee 2005). These unique beginners were
used to organize the nouns into 25 lexicographer ﬁles based on their semantic category
during WordNet development. Figure 2 shows the synsets at the top ofthe noun
hierarchy in WordNet. The 25 unique beginners have been shaded, and the two graphics
show how the hierarchy evolved between the two WordNet versions used in this study.

semeval07 75.5 86.2 64.8
total 81.4 89.3 73.5
We ran our initial experiments using these 25 WordNet categories as semantic
classes. The distribution ofwords for each semantic class, P( W|S), is estimated based
on WordNet sense frequencies. The distribution of words for each context, P(W|C), is
estimated using a 5-gram model based on the Web 1T corpus. The system ﬁrst ﬁnds the
most likely semantic class based on the noisy channel model, then picks the ﬁrst sense in
that class. Table 2 gives the results for the three data sets, which are signiﬁcantly higher
than the previously reported unsupervised results.
To illustrate which semantic classes are the most difﬁcult to disambiguate, Table 3
gives the confusion matrix for the Senseval2 data set. We can see that frequently occur-
ring concrete classes like person and body are disambiguated well. The largest source
oferrors are the abstract classes like act, attribute, cognition,andcommunication. These
25 classes may not be the ideal candidates for word sense disambiguation. Even though
they allow a sufﬁcient degree of ﬁne-grained distinction (Table 2 shows that we can get

even for a very small number of semantic classes. In our next experiment we look at
how well our approach can perform differentiating only two or three semantic classes.
We use Algorithm 2 applied to the appropriate version ofSemCor to pick the head
synsets used to deﬁne the semantic classes. Figure 2 shows that the top level ofthe
hypernym hierarchy has changed signiﬁcantly between the WordNet versions. Thus,
different head synsets are chosen for different data sets. However, the main distinction
captured by our semantic classes seems to be between mental and physical concepts.
Table 4 gives the results. The performance with a few semantic classes is comparable to
the top supervised algorithms in each ofthe three data sets.
4.3ThirdExperiment:TuningtheNumberofClasses
Increasing the number of semantic classes has two opposite effects on WSD perfor-
mance. The higher the number, the ﬁner distinctions we can make, and the maximum
possible ﬁne-grained accuracy goes up. However, the more semantic classes we deﬁne,
the more difﬁcult it becomes to distinguish them from one another. For an empirical
analysis ofthe efect ofsemantic class granularity on the ﬁne-grained WSD accuracy,
we generated different sets of semantic classes using the following algorithm.
Algorithm 3
1. Sort all the synsets according to their “subtree frequency”: i.e., the total
frequency of each synset’s descendants in the hypernym tree.
2. Take the desired number ofsynsets with the highest subtree frequency and
use them as head synsets, that is, split their descendants into separate
semantic classes.
Figure 3 shows the ﬁne-grained accuracy we achieved on the Senseval2 data set
with up to 600 semantic classes deﬁned based on Algorithm 3. Note the differences: (i)

Figure 1 gives the best possible oracle accuracy, Figure 3 gives the actual WSD accuracy;
(ii) Algorithm 2 chooses the head synsets based on their oracle score, Algorithm 3
chooses them based on their subtree frequency.
As we suspected, the relationship is not simple or monotonic. However, one can
identify distinct peaks at 3, 25, and 100–150 semantic classes. One hypothesis is that
these peaks correspond to “natural classes” at different levels of granularity. Here are
some example semantic classes from each peak:
3 classes entity, abstraction
25 classes action, state, content, location, attribute, ...
135 classes food, day, container, home, word, business, feeling, material, job, man, ...
To test the out-of-sample effect of tuning the semantic classes based on the peaks
ofFigure 3, we used the SemEval-2007 data set as our test sample. When the 135
semantic classes from the highest peak are used for the disambiguation of the nouns
in the SemEval-2007 data set, an accuracy of69.8% was achieved. This is higher than
the accuracy ofthe best supervised system on this task (68.6%), although the difference
is not statistically signiﬁcant.
5.Discussion
In this section we will address several questions raised by the results ofthe experi-
ments. Why do we get different results from different data sets? Are the best results
signiﬁcantly different than the ﬁrst-sense baseline? Can we improve our results using
better semantic classes?
5.1WhyDoWeGetDifferentResultsfromDifferentDataSets?
Table 5 summarizes our results from the three experiments of Section 4. There are some
signiﬁcant differences between the data sets.
121
Computational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 1
Table5
Result summary for the three data sets. The columns give the data set, the results of the three
experiments, best reported result, the ﬁrst-sense baseline, and the number ofinstances.
Data set Exp1 Exp2 Exp3 Best FSB Instances
senseval2 77.7 74.9 78.0 71.9 1,067
senseval3 70.1 72.9 72.0 71.0 892
semeval07 64.8 68.6 69.8 68.6 64.2 159
The SemEval-2007 data set appears to be signiﬁcantly different from the other two
with its generally lower baseline and scores. The difference in accuracy is probably
due to the difference in data preparation. In the two Senseval data sets all content
words were targeted for disambiguation. In the SemEval-2007 data set only verbs and
their noun arguments were selected, targeting only about 465 lemmas from about 3,500
words oftext. For the Senseval-3 data set none ofour results, or any published result
we know of, is signiﬁcantly above the baseline for noun disambiguation. This may be
due to extra noise in the data—the inter-annotator agreement for nouns in this data set
was 74.9%.
5.2AretheBestResultsSigniﬁcantlyDifferentThantheFSB?
Among all the published results for these three data sets, our two results for the
Senseval-2 data set and the top supervised result for the Senseval-2 data set are the
only ones statistically signiﬁcantly above the FSB for noun disambiguation at the 95%
conﬁdence interval. This is partly because ofthe lack ofsufﬁcient data. For example, the
SemEval-2007 data set has only 159 nouns; and a result of71.8% would be needed to
demonstrate a difference from the baseline of 64.2% at the 95% conﬁdence interval.
More importantly, however, statistical signiﬁcance should not be confused with
“signiﬁcance” in general. A statistically signiﬁcant difference may not be necessary or
sufﬁcient for a signiﬁcant impact on an application. Even a WSD system that is statis-
tically indistinguishable from the baseline according to the “total accuracy” metric is
most probably providing signiﬁcantly different answers compared to always guessing
the ﬁrst sense. There are metrics that can reveal these differences, such as “balanced
error rate” (i.e., arithmetic average of the error rates for different senses) or “accuracy in
detecting the use ofa non-dominant sense.”
Finally, the relatively high ﬁrst-sense baseline (e.g., 71.0% for Senseval-3 nouns)
combined with the relatively low inter-annotator agreement (e.g., 74.9% for Senseval-
3 nouns) makes progress in the traditional WSD task difﬁcult. Annotators who are
perfectly proﬁcient in comprehending language nevertheless ﬁnd it difﬁcult to distin-
guish between artiﬁcially-created dictionary senses. Ifour long term goal is to model
human competence in language comprehension, it would make sense to focus on tasks
at which humans are naturally competent. Dictionary-independent tasks such as lexical
substitution or textual entailment may be the right steps in this direction.
5.3CanWeImproveOurResultsUsingBetterSemanticClasses?
In order to get an upper bound for our approach, we searched for the best set of semantic
classes speciﬁc to each data set using the following greedy algorithm.

The performance ofthe noisy channel model with the best set ofsemantic classes picked for each
data set. The columns give the data set, the number ofclasses, maximum possible score ifthe
model always picks the correct class, percentage oftimes it actually picks the correct class, and
its ﬁne-grained accuracy.
Data Set NumClass MaxScore CorrClass Score
senseval2 23 89.2 88.8 80.1
senseval3 29 87.2 87.4 77.4
semeval07 12 84.9 89.9 79.2
Algorithm 4
1. Initialize all synsets to be in a single “default” semantic class.
2. For each synset, compute the following score: the WSD accuracy achieved
ifthat synset and all its descendants are split into a new semantic class.
3. Take the synset with the highest score and split that synset and its
descendants into a new semantic class.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the WSD accuracy can no longer be improved.
Algorithm 4 was run for each of the three data sets, which resulted in three different
sets ofsemantic classes. The noisy channel model was applied with the best set of
semantic classes for each data set. Table 6 summarizes the results. Note that these results
are not predictive ofout-of-sample accuracy because Algorithm 4 picks a speciﬁc set of
semantic classes optimal for a given data set. But the results do indicate that a better
set ofsemantic classes may lead to signiﬁcantly better WSD accuracy. In particular
each result in Table 6 is signiﬁcantly higher than previously reported supervised or
unsupervised results.
How to construct a good set ofsemantic classes that balance speciﬁcity and identi-
ﬁability is a topic ofongoing research. See Kohomban and Lee (2007) for a supervised
solution using feature-based clustering that tries to maintain feature–class coherence.
Non-parametric Bayesian approaches such as Teh et al. (2006) applied to context distri-
butions could reveal latent senses in an unsupervised setting.
6.RelatedWork
For a general overview ofdifferent approaches to WSD, see Navigli (2009) and
Stevenson (2003). The Senseval and SemEval workshops (Cotton et al. 2001; Mihalcea
and Edmonds 2004; Agirre, M`arquez, and Wicentowski 2007) are good sources ofrecent
work, and have been used in this article to benchmark our results.
Generative models based on the noisy channel framework have previously been
used for speech recognition (Bahl, Jelinek, and Mercer 1983), machine translation
(Brown et al. 1990), question answering (Echihabi and Marcu 2003), spelling correction
(Brill and Moore 2000), and document compression (Daume III and Marcu 2002) among
others. To our knowledge our work is the ﬁrst application ofthe noisy channel model
to unsupervised word sense disambiguation.
123
Computational Linguistics Volume 36, Number 1
Using statistical language models based on large corpora for WSD has been ex-
plored in Yuret (2007) and Hawker (2007). For speciﬁc modeling techniques used in this
article see Yuret (2008); for a more general review of statistical language modeling see
Chen and Goodman (1999), Rosenfeld (2000), and Goodman (2001).
Grouping similar senses into semantic classes for WSD has been explored in previ-
ous work. Senses that are similar have been identiﬁed using WordNet relations (Peters,
Peters, and Vossen 1998; Crestan, El-B`eze, and De Loupy 2001; Kohomban and Lee
2005), discourse domains (Magnini et al. 2003), annotator disagreements (Chklovski
and Mihalcea 2003), and other lexical resources such as Roget (Yarowsky 1992), LDOCE
(Dolan 1994), and ODE (Navigli 2006).
Ciaramita and Altun (2006) build a supervised HMM tagger using “supersenses,”
essentially the 25 WordNet noun categories we have used in our ﬁrst experiment in
addition to 15 verb categories similarly deﬁned. They report a supersense precision of
67.60 for nouns and verbs of Senseval-3. Table 2 gives our supersense score as 78% for
Senseval-3 nouns. However, the results are not directly comparable because they do not
report the noun and verb scores separately or calculate the corresponding ﬁne-grained
score to compare with other Senseval-3 results.
Kohomban and Lee (2007) go beyond the WordNet categories based on lexicogra-
pher ﬁles and experiment with clustering techniques to construct their semantic classes.
Their classes are based on local features from sense-labeled data and optimize feature–
class coherence rather than adhering to the WordNet hierarchy. Their supervised system
achieves an accuracy of74.7% on Senseval-2 nouns and 73.6% on Senseval-3 nouns.
The systems mentioned so far are supervised WSD systems. Agirre and Martinez
(2004) explore the large-scale acquisition ofsense-tagged examples from the Web and
train supervised, minimally supervised (requiring sense bias information from hand-
tagged corpora, similar to our system), and fully unsupervised WSD algorithms using
this corpus. They report good results on the Senseval-2 lexical sample data compared to
other unsupervised systems. Martinez, de Lacalle, and Agirre (2008) test a similar set of
systems trained using automatically acquired corpora on Senseval-3 nouns. Their mini-
mally supervised system obtains 63.9% accuracy on polysemous nouns from Senseval-3
(corresponding to 71.86% on all nouns).
7.Contributions
We have introduced a new generative probabilistic model based on the noisy channel
framework for unsupervised word sense disambiguation. The main contribution of this
model is the reduction ofthe word sense disambiguation problem to the estimation of
two distributions: the distribution ofwords used to express a given sense, and the dis-
tribution ofwords that appear in a given context. In this framework, context similarity
is determined by the distribution ofwords that can be placed in the given context. This
replaces the ad hoc contextual feature design process by a statistical language model,
allowing the advances in language modeling and the availability oflarge unlabeled
corpora to have a direct impact on WSD performance.
We have provided a detailed analysis ofusing coarse-grained semantic classes for
ﬁne-grained WSD. The noisy channel model is a good ﬁt for class-based WSD, where
the model decides on a coarse-grained semantic class instead ofa ﬁne-grained sense.
The chosen semantic class is then mapped to a speciﬁc sense based on the WordNet
ordering during evaluation. We show that the potential loss from using coarse-grained
classes is limited, and state-of-the-art performance is possible using only a few semantic
classes. We explore semantic classes at various levels ofgranularity and show that
124
Yuret and Yatbaz The Noisy Channel Model for Unsupervised WSD
the relationship between granularity and ﬁne-grained accuracy is complex, thus more
work is needed to determine an ideal set ofsemantic classes.
In several experiments we compare the performance of our unsupervised WSD
system with the best systems from previous Senseval and SemEval workshops. We
consistently outperform any previously reported unsupervised results and achieve
comparable performance to the best supervised results.
AppendixA:SolutionsforP(S|C)
To solve for P(S|C)usingP(W|C)andP(W|S), we represent the ﬁrst two as vectors:s
j
=
P(S=j|C=k)andw
i
= P(W=i|C=k), and the last one as a matrix: WS
ij
= P(W=
i|S=j). Our problem becomes ﬁnding a solution to the linear equation w=WS×s.
Using the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse, WS
+,weﬁndasolutions=WS
+
×w.This
solution minimizes the distance |WS×s−w|. There are two potential problems with
this pseudoinverse solution. First, it may violate the non-negativity and normalization
constraints ofa probability distribution. Second, a maximum likelihood estimate should
minimize the cross entropy between WS×s and w, not the Euclidean distance. We
addressed the normalization problem using a constrained linear solver and the cross-
entropy problem using numerical optimization. However, our experiments showed the
difference in WSD performance to be less than 1% in each case. The pseudoinverse
solution, s=WS
+
×w, can be computed quickly and works well in practice, so this
is the solution that is used in all our experiments.
AppendixB:EstimatingP(W|C)
Estimating P(W|C) for each context is expensive because the number of words that need
to be considered is large. The Web 1T data set contains 13.5 million unique words, and
WordNet deﬁnes about 150,000 lemmas. To make the computation feasible we needed
to limit the set ofwords for which P( W|C) needs to be estimated. We limited our set to
WordNet lemmas with the same part ofspeech as the target word. We further required
the word to have a non-zero count in WordNet sense frequencies. The inﬂection and
capitalization ofeach word W was automatically matched to the target word. As a
result, we estimated P(W|C) for about 10,000 words for each noun context and assumed
the other words had zero probability. The n-grams required for all the contexts were
listed, and their counts were extracted from the Web 1T data set in one pass. The P(W|C)
was estimated for all the words and contexts based on these counts. In the end, we only
used the 100 most likely words in each context for efﬁciency, as the difference in results
using the whole distribution was not signiﬁcant. For more details on smoothing with a
large language model see Yuret (2008), although we did not see a signiﬁcant difference
in WSD performance based on the smoothing method used.
