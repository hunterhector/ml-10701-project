In the context of spoken document search, Siegler (1999) described expected word counts and formulated a way to estimate expected word counts from lattices based on the relative ranks of word hypothesis probabilities; Chelba and Acero (2005) used a more explicit formula for computing word counts based on summing edge posterior probabilities in lattices; Saraclar and Sproat (2004) performed word-spotting in speech lattices by looking for word occurrences whose expected counts were above a certain threshold; and Yu et al.(2005) searched for phrases in spoken documents using a similar measure, the expected word relevance.

Chelba and Acero (2005) preprocessed lattices into more compact Position Specific Posterior Lattices (PSPL), and computed an aggregate score for each document based on the posterior probability of edges and the proximity of search terms in the document.
