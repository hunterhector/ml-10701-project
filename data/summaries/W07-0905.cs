While the Penn Treebank can report a productivity rate of between 750 and 1000 words per hour for their annotators after four months of training (Taylor et al., 2003) and the Penn Chinese treebank can report a rate of 240-480 words per hour (Chiou et al., 2001), our annotation speeds are significantly slower, ranging from 90 words per hour to 281.
