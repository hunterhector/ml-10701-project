The approach aims to minimize the expected loss of translation errors with regard to the BLEU score.
We show that MBR decoding on N-best lists leads to an improvement of translation quality.
We report the performance of the MBR decoder on four different tasks: the TCSTAR EPPS Spanish-English task 2006, the NIST Chinese-English task 2005 and the GALE Arabic-English and Chinese-English task 2006.
The absolute improvement of the BLEU score is between 0.2% for the TCSTAR task and 1.1% for the GALE ChineseEnglish task.
1 Introduction
In recent years, statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have achieved substantial progress regarding their perfomance in international translation tasks (TC-STAR, NIST, GALE).
Statisticalapproachestomachinetranslationwere proposed at the beginning of the nineties and found widespread use in the last years.
The ”standard” version of the Bayes decision rule, which aims at a minimization of the sentence error rate is used in virtually all approaches to statistical machine translation.
However, most translation systems are judged bytheirabilitytominimizetheerrorrateontheword level or n-gram level.
Common error measures are the Word Error Rate (WER) and the Position Independent Word Error Rate (PER) as well as evaluation metric on the n-gram level like the BLEU and NIST score that measure precision and fluency of a given translation hypothesis.
The remaining part of this paper is structured as follows: after a short overview of related work in Sec.
2, we describe the MBR decoder in Sec.
3. We present the experimental results in Sec.
4 and conclude in Sec.
5. 2 Related Work MBR decoder for automatic speech recognition (ASR) have been reported to yield improvement over the widely used maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) decoder (Goel and Byrne, 2003; Mangu et al., 2000; Stolcke et al., 1997).
For MT, MBR decoding was introduced in (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).
It was shown that MBR is preferable over MAP decoding for different evaluation criteria.
Here, we focus on the performance of MBR decoding for the BLEU score on various translation tasks.
3 Implementation
of Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for the BLEU Score 3.1 Bayes Decision Rule In statistical machine translation, we are given a source language sentence fJ1 = f1...fj ...fJ, which is to be translated into a target language sentence eI1 = e1 ...ei ...eI.
Statistical decision theory tells us that among all possible target language sentences, we should choose the sentence which minimizes the Bayes risk: ˆeˆI1 = argmin I,eI1 braceleftBigg summationdisplay Iprime,eprimeIprime1 Pr(eprimeIprime1 |fJ1 ) ·L(eI1,eprimeIprime1 ) bracerightBigg Here, L(·,·) denotes the loss function under consideration.
In the following, we will call this decision rule the MBR rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004).
101 Although it is well known that this decision rule is optimal, most SMT systems do not use it.
The most common approach is to use the MAP decision rule.
Thus, we select the hypothesis which maximizes the posterior probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ): ˆeˆI1 = argmax I,eI1 braceleftBig Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) bracerightBig This decision rule is equivalent to the MBR criterion under a 0-1 loss function: L0−1(eI1,eprimeIprime1 ) = braceleftbigg 1 if eI1 = eprimeIprime1 0 else Hence, the MAP decision rule is optimal for the sentence or string error rate.
It is not necessarily optimal for other evaluation metrics as for example the BLEU score.
One reason for the popularity of the MAP decision rule might be that, compared to the MBR rule, its computation is simpler.
3.2 Baseline
System The posterior probability Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) is modeled directly using a log-linear combination of several models (Och and Ney, 2002): Pr(eI1|fJ1 ) = exp parenleftBigsummationtextM m=1 λmhm(e I1,fJ1 ) parenrightBig summationtext Iprime,eprimeIprime1 exp parenleftBigsummationtextM m=1 λmhm(eprime Iprime1,fJ 1 ) parenrightBig (1) This approach is a generalization of the sourcechannel approach (Brown et al., 1990).
It has the advantage that additional models h(·) can be easily integrated into the overall system.
The denominator represents a normalization factor that depends only on the source sentence fJ1 . Therefore, we can omit it in case of the MAP decision rule during the search process.
Note that the denominator affects the results of the MBR decision rule and, thus, cannot be omitted in that case.
We use a state-of-the-art phrase-based translation system similar to (Matusov et al., 2006) including the following models: an n-gram language model, a phrase translation model and a word-based lexicon model.
The latter two models are used for both directions: p(f|e) and p(e|f).
Additionally, we use a word penalty, phrase penalty and a distortion penalty.
The model scaling factors λM1 are optimized with respect to the BLEU score as described in (Och, 2003).
3.3 BLEU
Score The BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) measures the agreement between a hypothesiseI1 generated by the MT system and a reference translation ˆeˆI1.
It is the geometric mean of n-gram precisions Precn(·,·) incombinationwithabrevitypenaltyBP(·,·)fortoo short translation hypotheses.
BLEU(eI1,ˆeˆI1) = BP(I, ˆI) · 4productdisplay n=1 Precn(eI1,ˆeˆI1)1/4 BP(I, ˆI) = braceleftbigg 1 if ˆI ≥ I exp(1 −I/ˆI) if ˆI < I Precn(eI1,ˆeˆI1) = summationtext wn1 minC(wn1|eI1),C(wn1|ˆeˆI1)} summationtext wn1 C(wn1|eI1) Here, C(wn1|eI1) denotes the number of occurrences of an n-gram wn1 in a sentence eI1.
The denominator of the n-gram precisions evaluate to the number of n-grams in the hypothesis, i.e.
I −n+1.
As loss function for the MBR decoder, we use: L[eI1,ˆeˆI1] = 1 − BLEU(eI1,ˆeˆI1).
While the original BLEU score was intended to be used only for aggregate counts over a whole test set, we use the BLEU score at the sentence-level during the selection of the MBR hypotheses.
Note that we will use this sentence-level BLEU score only during decoding.
The translation results that we will report later are computed using the standard BLEU score.
3.4 Hypothesis
Selection We select the MBR hypothesis among the N best translation candidates of the MAP system.
For each entry, we have to compute its expected BLEU score, i.e. the weighted sum over all entries in the N-best list.
Therefore, finding the MBR hypothesis has a quadratic complexity in the size of the N-best list.
To reduce this large work load, we stop the summation over the translation candidates as soon as the risk of the regarded hypothesis exceeds the current minimum risk, i.e. the risk of the current best hypothesis.
Additionally, the hypotheses are processed according to the posterior probabilities.
Thus, we can hope to find a good candidate soon.
This allows for an early stopping of the computation for each of the remaining candidates.
102 3.5 Global Model Scaling Factor During the translation process, the different submodels hm(·) get different weights λm.
These scaling factors are optimized with regard to a specific evaluation criteria, here: BLEU.
This optimization describes the relation between the different models but does not define the absolute values for the scaling factors.
Because search is performed using the maximum approximation, these absolute values are not needed during the translation process.
In contrast to this, using the MBR decision rule, we perform a summation over all sentence probabilities contained in the N-best list.
Therefore, we use a global scaling factor λ0 > 0 to modify the individual scaling factors λm: λprimem = λ0 ·λm,m = 1,...,M.
For the MBR decision rule the modified scaling factors λprimem are used instead of the original model scaling factors λm to compute the sentence probabilities as in Eq.
1. The global scaling factor λ0 is tuned on the development set.
Note that under the MAP decision rule any global scaling factor λ0 > 0 yields the same result.
Similar tests were reported by (Mangu et al., 2000; Goel and Byrne, 2003) for ASR.
4 Experimental
Results 4.1 Corpus Statistics We tested the MBR decoder on four translation tasks: the TC-STAR EPPS Spanish-English task of 2006, the NIST Chinese-English evaluation test set of 2005 and the GALE Arabic-English and ChineseEnglish evaluation test set of 2006.

Thenewswirepart is similar to the NIST task.
The newsgroups part covers posts to electronic bulletin boards, Usenet newsgroups, discussion groups and similar forums.
The corpus statistics of the training corpora are shown in Tab.

3. To measure the translation quality, we use the BLEU score.
With exception of the TC-STAR EPPS task, all scores are computed case-insensitive.
As BLEU measures accuracy, higher scores are better.

4. For each translation task, we tested the decoder on N-best lists of size N=10000, i.e. the 10000besttranslationcandidates.
Notethatinsome cases the list is smaller because the translation system did not produce more candidates.
To analyze the improvement that can be gained through rescoring with MBR, we start from a system that has already been rescored with additional models like an n-gram language model, HMM, IBM-1 and IBM-4.
It turned out that the use of 1000 best candidates for the MBR decoding is sufficient, and leads to exactly the same results as the use of 10000 best lists.
Similar experiences were reported by (Mangu et al., 2000; Stolcke et al., 1997) for ASR.
We observe that the improvement is larger for Table 3: GALE Arabic-English: corpus statistics.

5 Conclusions
We have shown that Minimum Bayes Risk decoding on N-best lists improves the BLEU score considerably.
The achieved results are promising.
The improvements were consistent among several evaluation sets.
Even if the improvement is sometimes small, e.g.
TC-STAR, it is statistically significant: the absolute improvement of the BLEU score is between 0.2% for the TC-STAR task and 1.1% for the GALE Chinese-English task.
Note, that MBR decoding is never worse than MAP decoding, and is therefore promising for SMT.
It is easy to integrate and can improve even well-trained systems by tuning them for a particular evaluation criterion.
