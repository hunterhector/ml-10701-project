Introduction
The Second Workshop on Syntax and Structure in Statistical Translation (SSST-2) was held on 20
June 2008 following the ACL-08: HLT conference hosted by Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio.
Like the first SSST workshop in 2007, it aimed to bring together researchers from different communities
working in the rapidly growing field of statistical, tree-structured models of natural language translation.
We selected eleven papers for this year’s workshop. There was a strong emphasis this year on the
use of explicit syntactic information: constituent structures (Yamamoto, Okuma and Sumita; Zhou,
Xiang, Zhu and Gao; Elming; Clark, Frederking and Levin; Lavie, Parlikar and Ambati), dependency
structures (Nikoulina and Dymetman; Ma, Ozdowska, Sun and Way), part-of-speech tags (Tillmann),
and combinations thereof (Ge, Ittycheriah and Papineni). These papers applied syntactic information
to grammar-based models as well as to phrase-based and word-based models. The program was
rounded out by papers describing new decoding techniques (Li and Khudanpur) and machine-learning
techniques (Subotin) for grammar-based translation models.
We would like to thank our authors and our Program Committee for making this year’s SSST workshop
another success.
