Abstract. Japanese relative clause constructions (RCC’s) are defined as
being the NP’s of structure ‘S NP’, noting the lack of a relative pronoun
or any other explicit form of noun-clause demarcation. Japanese relative
clause modification should be classified into at least two major semantic
types: case-slot gapping and head restrictive. However, these types for
relative clause modification cannot apparently be distinguished. In this
paper we propose a method of identifying a RCC’s type with a machine
learning technique. The features used in our approach are not only rep-
resenting RCC’s characteristics, but also automatically obtained from
large corpora. The results we obtained from evaluation revealed that our
method outperformed the traditional case frame-based method, and the
features that we presented were eﬀective in identifying RCC’s types.
1 Introduction
Japanese relative clause constructions (RCC’s) are defined as being the NP’s of
structure ‘S NP’, noting the lack of a relative pronoun or any other explicit form
of noun-clause demarcation[1]. Japanese relative clause constructions should be
classified into at least two major semantic types: case-slot gapping and head
restrictive. However, these types for relative clause constructions cannot appar-
ently be distinguished.
Given the types of Japanese relative clause constructions and a corpus of
Japanese relative clause construction instances, we present a machine learning
based approach to classifying RCC’s. We present a set of lexical and semantic
features that characterize RCC’s, and integrate them as a classifier to determine
RCC types. We use decision tree learning as the machine learning algorithm.
Distinguishing case-slot gapping and head restrictive relative clauses, or re-
solving the semantic relationship between the relative clause and its head noun
has several application domains, such as machine translation from Japanese[5].
It also has a place in text understanding tasks, such as splitting a long sentence
into multiple shorter sentences, and removing less important clauses to shorten
a sentence[6].

Corpus-Based Analysis of Japanese Relative Clause Constructions 47
Previously, relative clauses had been analyzed with rule-based methods that
utilized case frames[5,2]. Using hand-crafted rules and knowledge creates several
problems: the high cost of constructing them, and lower scalability and coverage.
Recently, due to the availability of very large corpora, corpus-based and ma-
chine learning-based approaches have been actively investigated[7]. Cooccurrence
information between nouns and verbs can be calculated from the syntactically
parsed corpus, and this information can be used preferentially instead of hand-
crafted case frames to determine whether a noun can be the filler of a case-slot
of a verb[7,11].
However, merely using the cooccurrence information between nouns and
verbs instead of case frames cannot provide a good solution to the analysis of
Japanese relative clauses. Clauses with high occurrence probability of the main
verb and the head noun can sometimes be head restrictive. Moreover, just be-
cause the head noun can be the filler of a case-slot of the verb does not always
mean that the clause as case-slot gapping. We have to rely on several diﬀer-
ent clues in order to realize accurate classification. Therefore, in this paper we
present eight features are eﬀective in classifying case-slot gapping and head re-
strictive relative clauses. Most of the features can be automatically acquired by
statistically analyzing a corpus as explained in section 4.
In section 2 we first describe the nature of Japanese RCC’s, and in section
3 we outline previous work on the analysis of Japanese relative clauses. In sec-
tion 4 we explain the features that we present in this paper, and in section 5
we explain the machine learning-based classifier, which uses the features in sec-
tion 4. In section 6 we describe the evaluation of the system and discuss the
experimental results.

Relative Clause Constructions
Japanese relative clause constructions have the structure ’SNP’, and constitute
a noun phrase as a whole. We will term the modifying S the “relative clause”, the
modified NP the “head NP”, and the overall NP a “relative clause construction”
or RCC[2]. Example RCCs are:
RCC should be classified into at least two major semantic types: case-slot gap-
ping and head restrictive. With case-slot gapping RCC’s (also called ‘inner’

relative clauses[14]), the head NP can be considered to have been gapped from a
case slot subcategorized by the main verb of the relative clause. Head restrictive
RCC’s (also called ‘outer’ relative clause[14]) occur when the relative clause mod-
ifies the head NP. In (a), the head NP “” (man) can be the subject of the main verb
of the relative clause, and in (b), the head NP “” (information) can be object of
the main verb. These RCC type are ‘inner’ relative clauses. In (c) the head NP “”
(smell) cannot fill the gap in the relative clause, and RCC type is ‘outer’.
The inherent diﬃculty in determining the type of RCC derives from the fact
that these two types of RCC are syntactically identical. Even if the relative clause
has case-slot gapping, the type of that clause is not always ‘inner’, because in
Japanese the main verb of the relative clause has often zero pronoun. We thus
have to disambiguate the individual RCC instances.

Work
Previous work on analyzing Japanese relative clauses has used case frames as
useful information. They have first tried to find the case frame for the main verb
of the relative clause and embedded the nouns in the clause into its case-slots.
The head noun is then tried to be embedded into the remaining case-slot in the
case frame. To determine whether a relative clause instance is ‘outer’ clause,
they have beforehand constructed a dictionary of the nouns that can be modi-
fied by ‘outer’ clause, such as “”(purpose), or “”(opinion). In one approach[5],
the instance is determined to be ‘outer’ clause, if the head noun is included
in the dictionary, regardless of the main verb of the relative clause. In another
approach[12], the instance is determined to be ‘outer’, if the head noun cannot
be embedded into a case-slot and the head noun is included in the dictionary.
Recently, cooccurrence information between verbs and nouns has been used
in analysis. Kawahara and Kurohashi[7] automatically extracted case frames
from very large corpora, and used the case frames to analyze Japanese relative
clauses. However, they judged the instances as ‘outer’ clauses, only if case-slot
filling did not succeed.
Murata[11] presented a statistical method of classifying whether the relative
clause is an ‘inner’ or an ‘outer’ clause. However this method cannot correctly
classify ‘outer’ relative clause which had high cooccurrence probability of the
main verbs and the head nouns.
4 Feature
Set to Classify RCC Type
In this section, we present eight features that can be considered to be eﬀective
in classifying ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ relative clauses.
1. Degree of possibility where the head noun can be modified by the
’outer’ relative clause (degree of ‘outerness’).
In Japanese, there are two ways of modification between verbs and nouns: nouns
modify verbs by filling a case-slot (noun → verb), and verbs modify nouns in

relative clauses (verb → noun). Some pairs of a verb and a noun can cooccur
only in RCC, and cannot cooccur by filling a case-slot of the verb. For example,
Therefore, we can measure the likelihood that the noun will be modified by
‘outer’ relative clauses, by calculating the diﬀerence in the frequency distribution
of verbs cooccurring in relative clauses against the frequency distribution of verbs
cooccurring in the case-slot relation (If the diﬀerence is larger, the probability
that the noun can be modified by the ‘outer’ relative clause becomes larger).
We calculate the likelihood as J(P
k
(v|n),P
m
(v|n)), the Jensen-Shannon dis-
tance between the cooccurrence probability where nouns fill the case-slots of
verbs(P
k
(v|n)) and the cooccurrence probability where verbs cooccur with nouns
in relative clauses(P
m
(v|n)). Given two probability distributions p,q, the Jensen-
Shannon distance is defined by the following formula[9]:

noun \	j�" (preparation) and verb \

��	j�" (prepara-
tion for running), though the noun cannot flll any case-slots of the verb, as in *\
	j�U
��" (*preparation runs). For nouns, some verbs only cooccur in relative
clauses, and a number of such verbs tend to be modifled by ‘outer’ clauses.
Table 1 shows the occurrence frequency of sample nouns and the number of
their cooccurring verbs in the relative clauses or in the case-slot relations. For
nouns that do not tend to be modifled by ‘outer’ clauses, such as \
�"(people),
\N�" (city), and \���"(television), the ratio between the frequency and the
number of verbs is almost the same between the relative clause and case-slot
cases. On the contrary, for nouns that tend to be modifled by ‘outer’ clauses,
such as \��"(intent), \��" (fact), and \;�"(preparation), the number of
verbs is much bigger in relation to clause cases, although the frequency is smaller.
The reason may be, as previously explained, that some verbs cooccur with the
nouns that tend to be modifled by the ‘outer’ clause only in relative clause
constructions.

(n) are the frequencies for relative clause
constructions. Table 2 shows the ‘outerness’ of sample nouns. The values of the
nouns that are often modified by ‘outer’ clauses are higher than those of the
nouns which tend to be modified by ‘inner’ clauses.
2. Cooccurrence information between head noun and main verb of
relative clause.
For a relative clause instance to be an ‘inner’ clause, the head noun has to fill
a case-slot of the main verb of the relative clause. Consider the following two
examples:
Whether a noun can fill a case-slot of a verb has been traditionally determined
using case frames. However, we use the cooccurrence information between the
head noun and the main verb. In this paper, the cooccurrence between nouns and
verbs is measured by mutual information. Taking into account the information
on case particles, mutual information is calculated with the following formula:
I(n,k; v)=log
p(n,k,v)
p(n,k)p(v), (5)

(resonate). On the contrary, in (b) \;" cannot flll any case-slots of the main
verb \ub�" (destruct) and can be considered to be modifled by the ‘outer’
relative clause. Therefore, if the head noun can flll a case-slot of the main verb,
the relation can be more plausibly assessed as ‘inner’.

3. Which case-slots are already filled for main verb by nouns in relative
clause.
As previously explained, if the head noun can fill the case-slot of the main verb of
the relative clause, the RCC instance can be judged as an ‘inner’ clause. However,
if the case-slot that the head noun can fill is already filled by the noun in the
relative clause, and hence unavailable for case-slot gapping, the rule cannot be
applied. Consider, for example, the following two cases:
Taking the situation into account, if a noun in the relative clause fills a case-
slot of the main verb, the mutual information for the case-slot is set to a very
small value M
min
.
4. Whether the head noun is modified by modifiers other than the
relative clause (other modifier).
Previous work on analyzing Japanese relative clauses has taking into account
only the head noun, and has not taking into account modifiers other than the
relative clause. Consider the following two examples:
where p(n;k) is the probability that noun n will cooccur with case particle k
and p(n;k;v) is the cooccurrence probability for noun n, case particle k and verb
v, and p(v) is the occurrence probability for verb v. The following seven case
particles were taken into account: (\U",\�",\t",\p",\�",\q", and \T�").
This is because only these case-slots can, in fact, be gapped to the head noun to
construct the relative clause.

In (a), since \�" (story) can flll the object (\�" case) case-slot of the main verb
\	X" (hear), the relation can be judged as ‘inner’. However, in (b), since the
object (\�" case) case-slot of the main verb \	X" is already fllled by the noun
\X�" (Japanese comic story), and \�" cannot flll any case-slot, the instance
is judged as ‘outer’.

If the head noun is modified by modifiers other than the relative clause, such
as adjectives, compound nouns, and “AB”(B of A), the relative clause type tends
to be ‘inner’. The function of ‘outer’ relative clause describes the content of the
head noun. If the head noun is modified by a modifier, the relative clause need
not describe it. Therefore, the type of relative clause tends to be ‘inner’.
To implement the idea, we define a feature ‘other modifier’. If the head
noun is modified by any modifiers other than the relative clause, its value is 1,
otherwise, 0

.
5. Whether head noun tends to be modified
As for the nouns which tend to be modified by ‘outer’ relative clauses, the relative
clauses describe the content of the head nouns. It is diﬃcult to understand their
meaning without any modification. Therefore we calculate the percentage to
what degree nouns are modified by any modifier in large corpora. Table 3 shows
the percentage for example nouns.

elements are already identified.
sidered to be modifled by the ‘outer’ relative clause. The second interpretation
is that \�$" can be the direct object(\�" case) of the main verb \�b" and
can be considered to be modifled by the ‘inner’ relative clause. On the contrary,
(b) has only the interpretation of ‘inner’.

The percentages of nouns \��"(intention) and \��"(fleld), which tend to
be modifled by ‘outer’ relative clause, are close to 1, that is to say, such nouns
must have any modiflcation. We consider, the higher this percentage, the higher
the possibility that the noun is modifled by ‘outer’ relative clause.
6. Percentage where \qMO" is inserted between relative clause and
head nouns
\qMO" is a function expression that is sometimes inserted between relative
clauses and head nouns. Table 4 shows the percentage where \qMO" cooccurs
with example nouns.

7. Whether head noun tends to be modified by past-tensed relative
clauses(tense information)
Table 5. Tense of main verb and distribution of inner/outer
To implement this idea, we first calculated deviations in the distribution of
tense for the relative clauses. The percentage of past-tense main verbs in all
relative clauses, R
past, and the average for all the nouns were calculated. Table
6 shows the results for sample nouns.
Table 6. Percentage of past-tense main verbs

In Japanese, there are just two tense surface markers: present and past. Therefore,
future tense is indicated by the present tense on the surface.
The percentages of nouns \�_"(opinion) and \�"(rumor), which tend to
be modifled by ‘outer’ relative clause, are higher than the average. We consider,
the higher this percentage, the higher possibility that the noun is modifled by
‘outer’ relative clause.
Some nouns tend to be modifled by past-tense relative clauses, and others
tend to be modifled by those in the present tense. Consider, for example, the
following two nouns: \-h"(plan) and \G1" (memory). Both nouns are con-
sidered to imply the concept of time (future or past)
4
.
-hG1
(plan) (memory)
tense inner outer inner outer
present 6 89 12 0
past 5 0 5 83
For each of the two nouns \-h"(plan) and \G1"(memory), we examined
100 relative clause instances that had the noun as the head noun (Table 5).If
the head noun implies the concept of time, the tense of the main verb of the
relative clause tends to coincide with this concept. Furthermore, note that the
tense of the main verb of ‘outer’ relative clauses is the same as the time concept
of the head noun. From this, if the noun tends to be modifled by a speciflc-tense
relative clause, the relative clause tends to be ‘outer’, and if the tense of the
main verb contradicts the time concept of the head noun (tense of frequently
modifled relative clauses), the relative clause should be determined as ‘inner’.

�Average of
(plan) (memory) (place) (people) all nouns
0.032 0.958 0.333 0.422 0.322
For a head noun which does not imply the concept of time (\	�	t" (place) and
\
�"(people)), the percentage is near average. On the contrary, \-h"(plan)
and \G1"(memory) which imply the concept of time have an extreme value.
54 T. Abekawa and M. Okumura
Taking into account the actual tense of the relative clause instances, we
calculated the following score:
V
past
braceleftbigg
R
past
− AV G
past
in case of present tense
AV G
past
− R
past
in case of past tense
(6)
For a head noun not implying the concept of time, in either tense of the main
verb, the score is rather low, and a decision on inner/outer might not be af-
fected by the score. For a head noun implying the concept of time, the ab-
solute value of the score is rather large, and if the tense of the main verb is
the same as the time concept, the score becomes negative; otherwise the score
becomes positive.
8. Whether main verb has a sense of ‘exclusion’
The last feature is for identifying exceptional ‘outer’ relative clause. Consider
the following two examples:
5 Machine
Learning Based Classifier for RCC Type
We integrated the eight features in described the last section and used the ma-
chine learning approach to determine the RCC type. We used C5.0[13] as the
machine learning algorithm.
C5.0 is a decision-tree based classification system that has been used in nat-
ural language processing, such as text classification, chunking, text summariza-
tion, and ellipsis resolution[10]. C5.0 takes a set of training instances with a
feature vector and correct type as input, and induces a classifier which charac-
terizes the given feature space.
Since we use only eight features, we think even the state of the art machine
learning method like SVM would yield almost the same accuracy as decision-tree.
Furthermore decision-tree are more easily interpreted by human than SVMs.

These examples are ‘outer’ relative clauses, and this RCC type is identifled by
the main verb which has sense of exclusion. There are a few verbs which indicate
the RCC type by itself. Therefore, we deflned a feature ‘excluding verb’. If the
main verb contains a character ‘	�’ (which has sense of exclusion), the feature
is set to 1, otherwise, 0.

6.1 Experiment
Cooccurrence and other statistical information used in this work were calculated
from the corpus of a collection of twenty-two years of newspaper articles. The
corpus was parsed with KNP[8], which is a rule-based Japanese syntactic parser.
The cooccurrence information we obtained was as follows: the number of f
k
(n,v)
was about 60.8 million, and the number of f
m
(n,v) was about 12.4 million.
The data used in the evaluation was a set of RCC instances randomly ex-
tracted from the EDR corpus[4] which had syntactically analyzed. Then, a label,
whether the relative clause is ‘inner’ or ‘outer’, was manually annotated. The
statistics on the data are shown in Table 7. Evaluation with C5.0 was carried
out by way of 5-fold cross validation.

The baseline we used determines all instances as ‘inner’ relative clauses. We
also compared our approach with the traditional method with case frames, and
a method that uses only cooccurrence information (features 2 and 3 in section 4.
An evaluation measure is an accuracy, which is defined as the number of correctly
identified RCCs divided by the number of all RCCs. And for inner/outer relative
clauses, precision and recall are calculated.
Precision =
#number of correctly identified relative clauses
#number of inner/outer attempted by system
Recall =
#number of correctly identified relative clauses
#number of inner/outer relative clauses
The results are shown in Table 8. The generated decision tree from all instances
is shown in Figure 1. The last values on each line, for example ‘22/2’ and ‘444/6’,
indicated ‘number of applied examples / number of misclassification’.
6.2 Discussion
Accuracy of our approach is higher than that of the traditional approach. Our
approach works well especially for identifying ‘outer’ relative clause. Further-
more, using only cooccurrence information could not yield better performance
for ‘outer’ relative clause. Therefore, we conclude that the features in our ap-
proach can eﬀectively identify the ‘outer’ relative clause.
Figure 1 shows that the most contributive feature except ‘excluding verb’
is the degree of ‘outerness’. This feature can classify many instances with high
accuracy (98.6%=438/444). If the degree of ‘outerness’ is smaller than certain
threshold, RCC type is ‘inner’ with high probability.
The second contributing feature is the ‘other modifier’. If modifiers other
than the relative clause exist, RCC type is ‘inner’. However, the accuracy of this
feature is not so good compared with other features.
We unfortunately could not find the ‘tense information’ in our decision tree.
We consider the reason to be that nouns which imply the concept of time are
very few, and there might be no instances which contain them.
7 Conclusions
In this paper, we presented eight lexical and semantic features that characterized
RCC, and we integrated them using machine learning approach to determine the
RCC type.
Evaluation proved that our approach outperformed the traditional case
frame-based method, and the features that we presented were eﬀective in classi-
fying types into ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ relative clauses.
After identification of ‘inner’ clauses, case identification will be necessary for
semantic analysis. This will be considered in future work.
