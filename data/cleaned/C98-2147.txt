Abstract 
We present a novel OCR error correction method 
for languages without word delimiters that have a 
large character set, such as Japanese and Chinese. 
It consists of a statistical OCR model, an approxi
mate word matching method using character shape 
similarity, and a word segmentation algorithm us
ing a statistical language model. By using a sta
tistical OCR model and character shape similarity, 
the proposed error corrector outperforms the previ
ously published method. When the baseline char
acter recognition accuracy is 90%, it achieves 97.4% 
character recognition accuracy. 
1 Introduction

As our society is becoming more computerized, peo
ple are getting enthusiastic about entering every
thing into computers. So the need for OCR in areas 
such as office automation and information retrieval 
is becoming larger, contrary to our expectation. 
In Japanese, although the accuracy of printed 
character OCR is about 98~, sources such as old 
books, poor quality photocopies, and faxes are still 
difficult to process and cause many errors. The accu
racy of handwritten OCR is still about 90% (Hilde
brandt and Liu, 1993), and it worsens dramatically 
when the input quality is poor. If NLP techniques 
could be used to boost the accuracy of handwriting 
and poor quality documents, we could enjoy a very 
large market for OCR related applications. 
OCR error correction can be thought of a spelling 
correction problem. Although spelling correction 
has been studied for several decades (Kukich, 1992), 
the traditional techniques are implicitly based on 
English and cannot be used for Asian languages such 
as Japanese and Chinese. 
The traditional strategy for English spelling cor
rection is called isolated word error correction: Word 
boundaries are placed by white spaces. If the tok
enized string is not in the dictionary, it is a non
word. For a non-word, correction candidates are re
trieved fl'om the dictionary by approximate string 
match techniques using context-independent word 
distance measures such as edit distance (Wagner and 
Fischer, 1974) and ngram distance (Angell et al., 
1983). 
Recently, statistical language models and feature
based method have been used for context-sensitive 
spelling correction, where errors are corrected con
sidering the context in which the error occurs 
(Church and Gale, 1991; Mays et al., 1991; Golding 
and Schabes, 1996). Similar techniques are used for 
correcting the output of English OCRs (Tong and 
Evans, 1996) and English speech recognizers (Ring
ger and Allen, 1996). 
There are two problems in Japanese (and Chinese) 
spelling correction. The first is the word boundary 
problem. It is impossible to use isolated word error 
correction techniques because there are no delimiters 
between words. The second is the short word prob
lem. Word distance measures are useless because the 
average word length is short (< 2), and the charac
ter set is large (> 3000). There are a much larger 
number of one edit distance neighbors for a word, 
compared with English. 
Recently, the first problem was solved by selecting 
the most likely word sequence from all combinations 
of exactly and approximately matched words using a 
Viterbi-like word segmentation algorithm and a sta
tistical language model considering unknown words 
and non-words (Nagata, 1996). However, the second 
problem is not solved yet, at least elegantly. The so
lution presented in (Nagata, 1996) which sorts a list 
of one edit distance words considering the context 
in which it will be placed is inaccurate because the 
context itself might include some errors. 
In this paper, we present a context-independent 
approximate word match method using character 
shape similarity. This is suitable for languages with 
large character sets, such as Japanese and Chinese. 
We also present a method to build a statistical OCR 
model by smoothing the character confusion proba
bility using character shape similarity. 
It seems previous NLP researchers are reluctant 
922 
to use resources such as the character confusion ma
trix and feature vectors of the characters, and try to 
solve the problem by using only linguistic devices. 
We found that, by using character shape similarity, 
the resulting OCR error corrector is robust and ac
curate enough to correct unrestricted texts with a 
wide range of recognition accuracies. 
2 OCR
Model 
2.1 Noisy
Channel Model 
First, we formulate tile spelling correction of OCR 
errors in the noisy channel paradigm. Let C rep
resent the input string and X represent the OCR 
output string. Finding the most probable string 
given the OCR output X amounts to maximizing 
the function P(XIC)P(C), 
= argmcaxP(ClX ) = argmc~xP(XIC)P(C ) (1) 
because Bayes' rule states that, 
P(XIC)P(C) P(CIX) P(X) 
(2) 
P(C) is called the language model. It is computed 
from the training corpus. Let us call P(XIC ) the 
OCR model. It can be computed from the a priori 
likelihood estimates for individual characters, 
P(XlC) = II P(xiM) (a) 
i=1 
where n is the string length. P(xilci) is called the 
characters confusion probability. 
2.2 Zero-Frequency Problem 
The character confusion probabilities are computed 
from the character confusion matrix, which is a set of 
the frequencies of the input-output character pairs of 
the OCR. The confusion matrix, however, is highly 
dependent on the character recognition method and 
the quality of the input image. It is a labor intensive 
task to make a confusion matrix, since Japanese has 
more than 3,000 characters. But the more serious 
problem is that the confusion matrix is too sparse 
to be used for statistical modeling. 
For example, suppose the word "t~1~" (environ
ment) is incorrectly recognized as a non-word "~ 
~". The following is an excerpt of a confusion ma
trix, where the pair of a character and a number 
separated by a slash represents the output character 
and its frequency. 
input character ~: 
~/1289 ~/t ~/i 
input character ~: 
Even if we collect more than one thousand recog
nition examples, there are no examples in which '~' 
is recognized as '~'. To compute the confusion prob
ability P(~I~), we need a smoothing method. 
This is called the zero-frequency problem. Al
though it has been studied in many areas such 
as speech recognition, statistical language modeling 
and text compression, no previous work has exam
ined on tile smoothing of the character confusion 
probabilities. This is probably because the problem 
arises only when we consider OCR error correction 
of languages with large character sets. 
We propose a novel method to smooth the char
acter confusion probabilities. First, we estimate the 
sum of tile probabilities of novel events. We then 
distribute the probability mass to each novel event 
based oIl character similarity. 
We use a scheme, which we refer to as the Witten
Bell method (Witten and Bell, 1991), to estimate the 
sum of the probabilities for M1 novel events because 
it is simple and robust 1 Let C(ci,cj) be the fre
quency of events where ci and cj are the input and 
the output characters, respectively. Let fl(ci) be the 
sum of the probabilities of unseen output charac
ters where the input character is ci. By using the 
Witten-Bell method, ~(ci) is estimated as, 
= P( jlcl) 
cj :C( cl ,cj ):~O 
= E, cj)) (4) 
E, c( i, + E, 
where 
1 ifx>O 
®(x)= 0 otherwise (5) 
In the above example, '~' appears 1291(= 1289+ 1 + 
1) times as input and there are three distinct char
acters in the output. Therefore, the probability of 
observing novel characters is 3/(1291 + 3) = 3/1294. 
One of the possible alternatives to the Witten-Bell 
method is the Good-Turing method (Good, 1953). 
But we didn't use the method since it assumes the 
distribution of the frequency of frequencies to be rel
atively smooth, which is not the case in the character 
confusion matrix. 
2.3 Back-off Smoothing 
Both the Witten-Bell and Good-Turing methods do 
not in themselves tell one how to share ~(ci) among 
~In (Witten and Bell, 1991), the method is referred to as 
"method C" for estimating the escape probability in a text 
compression method, Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM). 
It estimates the probability of observing novel events to be r/(n + r), 
where n is the total number of events seen previ
ously, and r is the number of symbols that are distinct. The 
probability of the event observed c times is c/(n + r). 
923 
the distinct unseen events. The simplest strategy 
is to assume all unseen events are equally probable, 
but this is not reasonable because recognition errors 
are more likely to occur among characters with simi
lar shapes. Therefore, we distributed the probability 
mass ~(ci) based on character shape similarity com
puted from feature vectors. 
First, we made an appropriate number of charac
ter classes in which similar characters are gathered. 
This is done by clustering the feature vectors of each 
character; details are described in the next subsec
tion. We then made a confusion matrix between the 
character classes from the character confusion ma
trix. Let C(class~, class j) be the frequency that the 
characters in class~ are recognized as the characters 
in classy. It is computed as the sum of the elements 
in the character confusion matrix associated with 
the characters in classi and classj. 
C(classi,classj)= E C(ci,cj) (6) 
el 6class I ,cj 6class j 
By using the Witten-Bell method, we can esti
mate the class confusion probabilities between arbi
trary classes. We then distribute the probability for 
unseen events in proportion ~o the class confusion 
probability, 
P(cj\[ci) = a(ci)P(class(cj)lclass(ci)) (7) 
where 
= (8) ~--~ ~ :c(~i ,~j)=0 P( class ( Cj )1 class ( ci ) ) 
is a normalizing constant, and class(ci) is the func
tion that returns the class of character c~. 
Numerical values for a's as well as the charac
ter class confusion probabilities can be precomputed. 
Therefore, the method is computationally efficient. 
2.4 Character
Clustering 
In general, character recognition consists of feature 
extraction and classification. Feature extraction is 
applied to concentrate the information in the im
age into a few, highly selective features. Classifica
tion is accomplished by comparing the feature vec
tor corresponding to the input character with the 
representatives of each character, using a distance 
metric. Therefore, if we cluster feature vectors of 
each character, the members of the resulting class 
are characters with similar shape, and so tend to 
cause confusion. 
The feature we used in the clustering experi
ment is PDC (Peripheral Direction Contributivity) 
(Hagita et al., 1983), which is one of the best features 
for Japanese character recognition 2. We clustered 
the feature vectors for 3021 Japanese characters into 
128 classes by using the LBG algorithm (Linde et 
al., 1980), which is one of the most popular vector 
quantization methods. 
Let's go back to the previous example of estimat
ing P(~\]~). After character clustering, '~' and '~' 
are clustered into class 29 and 119, respectively. 
class 29 (including ~): 
class 119 (including ~): 
Here is the excerpt of the class confusion matrix for 
class 29. 
input class 29: 
29/30884 87/23 33/21 59/20 15/9 119/7 94/6 
78/6 28/5 2/4 109/4 101/4 71/4 104/3 107/3 
21/3 58/3 70/2 113/2 56/2 0/2 34/2 38/2 26/2 
18/2 44/1 72/1 50/1 30/1 102/1 19/1 89/1 
110/1 4/1 122/1 123/1 
Since class 29 appears 31036(30884 + 23 +...) 
times as input and there are 36 distinct classes 
in the output, where class 119 appeared 7 times, 
P(classn91class29) = 7/(31036 + 36) = 7/31072. 
This class confusion probability and the normalizing 
constant c~(~;) are used to compute P(~I~) using 
equation (7). 
3 Language
Model 
3.1 Word
Segmentation Model 
Let the input Japanese character sequence be C = 
clc2...cm, which can be segmented into word se
quence W = wlw2...wn. We approximate P(C) 
in Equation (1) by the joint probability of word se
quence P(W). P(W) is then approximated by the 
product of word bigram probabilities P(wi\[wi-1). 
n 
P(C) ~ P(W) = H P(wilwi-1) (9) 
i=l 
2PDC features are formed by assigning stroke directions 
to pixels and selecting just pixels on the first, second, and 
third stroke encountered by the scan line. The marginal dis
tribution of the four direction contributivity of such three pix
els is then taken along 16 lines in eight different directions. 
Therefore, the dimension of the original PDC feature vector is 
8"3"4"16=1536. By using 2-stage feature selection, it can be 
reduced to 256, while still preserving the original recognition 
ability. 
924 
Using the language model (9), the OCR error cor
rection task can be defined as finding a word se
quence I/V that maximizes the joint probability of 
word sequence given recognized character sequence 
P(WIX ). By using Bayes' rule, this amounts to 
maximizing the product of P(XIW ) and P(W). 
lfi/= arg mwax p(wIx) -= arg n~xP(XIW)P(W)(10) 
The maximization search can be efficiently imple
mented by using the ViterbMike dynamic program
ing procedure described in (Nagata, 1996). The 
algorithm starts fi'om the beginning of the input 
sentence, and proceeds character by character. At 
each point in the sentence, it looks up the combina
tion of the best partial word segmentation hypoth
esis ending there and all word hypotheses starting 
there. The word hypotheses proposed at each point 
include both exactly matched words and approxi
mately matched words. All prefixes of the substring 
starting at the point are also proposed as unknown 
words if they are not in the dictionary. 
3.2 Word
Model for Unknown Words 
We defined a statistical word model to assign a rea
sonable word probability to an arbitrary substring 
in the input sentence. The word model is formally 
defined as the joint probability of the character se
quence wi = cl .. • ck if it is an unknown word. We 
decompose it into the product of word length prob
ability and word spelling probability, 
P(wII<UNK>) = P(cl ... ck I<UNK>) = P(k)P(cl... ck Ik) (11) 
where k is the length of the character sequence and 
<UI~K> represents unknown word. 
We assume that word length probability P(k) 
obeys a Poisson distribution whose parameter is the 
average word length )~ in the training corpus. This 
ineans that we regard word length as the interval 
between hidden word boundary markers, which are 
randomly placed with an average interval equal to 
the average word length. 
(,~ 1) k-1 
e -(~-1) (12) P(k)(k-l)! 
We approximate the spelling probability given 
word length P(o...cklk) by the word-based char
acter bigram model, regardless of word length. 
k 
P(c,... ck) = P(cl 1#) II P(cilc,-1)P(#lck) (13) 
i=2 
where "#" indicates the word boundary marker. 
4 Approximate
Word Matching 
Since there are no delimiters between words in 
Japanese, we have to hypothesize all substrings in 
the input sentence as words, and retrieve their ap
proximately matching words from the dictionary as 
correction candidates. The most likely correction 
candidate is selected by the word segmentation algo
rithm using the OCR model and tile language model. 
For simplicity, we will present the method as if it 
were for an isolated word error correction. 
In English spelling correction, correction candi
dates are generated by the minimum edit distance 
technique (Wagner and Fischer, 1974). Edit dis
tance is the mininlum number of editing operations 
(insertions, deletions, and substitutions) required to 
transform one string into another. Since the tar
get is OCR output, we can restrict the type of er
rors to substitutions only. Thus, the edit distance 
of two words becomes c/n, where c is the number of 
matched characters and n is the length of the mis
spelled (and the dictionary) word. Since the cost of 
computing the edit distance between a string and all 
dictionary words is expensive, we create an inverted 
index into the dictionary using character bigrams as 
the access keys (Angell et al., 1983). 
In Japanese OCR spelling correction, it is rea
sonable to generate correction candidates by edit 
distance for words longer than 2 characters since 
the number of correction candidates would be small. 
However, for two character words, edit distance is 
useless, because there are a large number of words 
with one edit distance. Since the average word 
length of Japanese is about two characters, this is 
a serious problem. 
We propose an approximate word matching 
method that uses character similarity. Let X be a 
non-word caused by OCR errors, and W be a cor
rection candidate word. X would be corrected by W 
if the following relationship holds, 
P(X)P(XIX) < P(W)P(XIW) (14) 
The left hand side represents the probability that 
X is an unknown word and that it is correctly rec
ognized. The right hand side represents the proba
bility that W is incorrectly recognized as X. The 
larger the product of the word unigram probability 
P(W) and tim word confusion probability P(XIW ), 
the more likely word W is the correct word for X. 
Therefore, for two character words, we sort the list 
of all one edit distance words by P(W)P(X\]W), and 
select the top-k words as the correction candidates. 
For example, if "~tJ~" is incorrectly recognized as 
"~t~", there are at least 20 dictionary words whose 
edit distance is one. 
925 
If we sort the list of one edit distance words by 
P(W), P(XIW), and P(W)P(XIW), the correction 
candidates become as follows, 
sorted by P(W): 
t~ ~ ~ t~ ~ ... 
sorted by P(XIW) : 
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ... 
sorted by P(W) P(XlW): 
~ ~{~ ~ \[~ ~:~ ... 
Thus, by using P(W)P(XIW), we can make "~ 
~" the most likely correction word. The approxi
mate word matching method is so accurate that, in 
practice, it is sufficient to use only the top 5 candi
dates. This makes the program very efficient. 
5 Experiments

5.1 Training
Data for the Language Model 
We used the EDR Japanese Corpus Version 1.0 
(EDR, 1991) to train the language model. It is a 
corpus of approximately 5.1 million words (208 thou
sand sentences). It contains a variety of Japanese 
sentences taken from newspapers, magazines, dic
tionaries, encyclopedias, textbooks, etc. It has a 
variety of annotations including word segmentation, 
pronunciation, and part of speech. 
In this experiment, we randomly selected 9070 of 
the sentences in the EDR Corpus for training. The 
first column of Table 1 shows the number of sen
tences, words, and characters of the training set.

There were 133281 distinct words in the training 
data. We discarded the words whose fl'equency was 
one, and made a dictionary of 65152 words. We then 
counted the vocabulary dependent word bigrams. 
That is, the words that were not in the dictionary 
were replaced with the unknown word symbol <UNK> 
before counting the bigrams. There were 758172 
distinct word bigrams. We discarded the bigrams 
whose frequency was one, and the remaining 294668 
bigrams were used in the word segmentation model. 
In the word model, we used 3167 character uni
grams and 91198 character bigrams. All unigrams 
and bigrams whose frequencies were one were dis
carded. As for the average word length, instead of 
averaging all words in the corpus (=1.58), we aver
aged the words whose frequency was one (=4.76) in 
order to avoid the influence of highly frequent words. 
5.2 Testl: Handwritten OCR 
We designed two experiments to evaluate the perfor
mance of the OCR error corrector. The first experi
ment used simulated outputs of a handwriting OCR, 
while the second used real outputs of a printed char
acter OCR. 
The first experiment was designed to test the OCR 
error corrector over a wide range of baseline recogni
tion accuracies. The use of the OCR simulator was 
necessary because it is very difficult to obtain a large 
amount of test data with arbitrary accuracies. 
We selected 100 sentences from the remaining 1070 
of the EDR corpus for testing. The second column 
of Table 1 shows the number of sentences, words, 
and characters of the test set. By using an OCR 
simulator, we made four sets of character matrices 
whose first-rank recognition accuracies were 70%, 
80%, 90%, and 95%. They contained at most 10 
candidates for each character and their cumulative 
recognition accuracies were 9070, 9570, 98%, and 
98%, respectively. 
For comparison, we implemented the OCR er
ror correction method, which does not use char
acter similarity information, presented in (Nagata, 
1996). Instead of using character confusion matrix, 
he approximated it by the correct character distri
bution over the rank of the candidates 3. We refer 
to his method as the candidate rank method, and 
our method as the character similarity method. 
Figure 1 shows the recognition accuracies after er
ror correction for various baseline OCR accuracies. 
The horizontal axis represents the accuracies of the 
baseline OCR, while the vertical axis represents the 
accuracies after error correction. The farther the 
point lies above the diagonal line, the more improve
ments are brought by the OCR error corrector. 
3In (Nagata, 1996), it was assumed that the rank order 
distribution of the correct characters is a geometric distribu
tion whose parameter is the accuracy of the first candidate. 
Let cl be the i-th character in the input, xij be the j-th can
didate for ci in the output, and p be the probability that the 
first candidate is correct. The confusion probability P(xij Ici) 
is approximated a~, 
P(x~jlci) "~ P(xij is correct) ~ p(1 -p)j-1

The character similarity method is significantly 
better than the candidate rank method for all base
line recognition accuracies examined. For example, 
when the baseline accuracy is 90%, the character 
similarity method achieved 97.4%, while the accu
racy of the candidate rank method was 93.9% 4 
5.3 Test2: Printed Character OCR 
The second experiment was designed to test the 
OCR error corrector on unrestricted text and un
known OCR. In the first experiment, although the 
test sentences were open data, their statistical char
acteristics are expected to be similar to the training 
data because both of them were taken from the same 
corpus. Moreover, since the OCR simulator and the 
OCR error corrector used the same character confu
sion matrix, the input character matrices were closed 
data with respect to OCR. 
We selected 30 documents, each of which con
tained about 1000 characters. These documents had 
nothing to do with the EDR corpus. Ten of them 
were newspapers and the other 20 documents were 
a miscellaneous collection of novels, essays, patents, 
laws, scientific papers, etc.. Table 2 shows the break
down of document type and image resolution. News
papers were scanned at 300dpi and 400dpi, two of 
4(Nagata, 1996) reported that, when the baseline accuracy 
is 90%, his method achieved 96.3%. The difference between 
96.3% and 93.9% comes from the difference in the corpora. 
tie tested the ATR corpus whose word perplexity is about 30, 
while we tested the EDR corpus whose perplexity is about 95. 
tlere, perplexities are computed using word bigram model. 
Table 2: The document type and the image resolu
tion of the test data for the printed character OCR

miscellaneous 
them, scanned at 300dpi, were discarded because of 
low quality. Other miscellaneous documents were 
mainly scanned at 200dpi and 300dpi. Ten that used 
smaller fonts were also scanned at 400dpi. 
The printed character OCR used was a commer
cial product (RICOH Yomitori-Monogatari). It out
puts at most 10 candidates for each character as well 
as a score ranging from 0 to 100 that represents the 
certainty of the first candidate. In fact, we know 
nothing about the algorithm and the training data 
of the OCR. At least, the training data should be 
different from ours since one is created for printed 
characters while the other was designed for hand
written characters. 
The 68 test document images contained 69102 in
put characters. After character recognition, there 
were 69305 output characters where 67639 (97.9%) 
characters were correct. There were 1422 (2.1%) re
placement errors, 244 (0.4%) insertion errors and 41 
(0.06%) deletion errors.

By using the OCR error corrector, 575 characters 
were corrected, where 294 were right and 281 were 
wrong. The net improvelnent was only 13 charac

tion: 24 documents were improved, 30 documents 
got worse, and 14 documents were unchanged. 
Figure 2 indicates that the OCR error corrector 
improves the accuracy when the baseline recognition 
accuracy is less than 98%, while it worsens when the 
accuracy is more than 98%. This is mainly because 
of wrong corrections, where unknown words in the 
original text are replaced by more frequent words in 
the dictionary. Most unknown words are numbers, 
acronyms, and transliterated foreign words. 
Wrong correction can be avoided if the certainty of 
the character recognition (OCR score) is available. 
Table 3 shows the number of right and wrong cor
rections when correction is allowed only if the the 
OCR score is less than a certain threshold. The 
score of the printed character OCR ranges from 0 
to 100, where 100 means it is pretty sure about the 
output. If we reject the corrections suggested by the 
error corrector when the OCR score is more than 
80, the number of wrong corrections is reduced from 
281 to 48, while that of right correction is reduced 
from 294 to 199. Thus, the number of net improve
ments increases from 13 to 151, which means a 10.6% 
(151/1422) reduction in replacement errors. 
6 Discussion

Most previous works on Japanese OCR error cor
rection considered only printed character OCRs 
and their target domain was limited. (Takao and 
Nishino, 1989) used part of speech bigram model 
and heuristic templates for unknown words. They 
achieved about 95% accuracy when the baseline ac
curacy was 91% for magazines and introductory 
textbooks of science and technology. (Ito and 
Maruyama, 1992) used part of speech bigram model 
and beam search in order to get multiple candidates 
in their interactive OCR corrector. They achieved 
94.61% accuracy when the baseline accuracy was 
87.46% for patents in electric engineering. We used 
word bigram model, a statistical word model for un
known words, and a statistical OCR model. We 
achieved 97.4% accuracy, when the baseline accu
racy was 90% and the domain was not limited. 
It is very difficult to compare our results with the 
previous results because the experiment conditions 
are completely different. However, considering the 
fact that we did not restrict the target domain, our 
method arguably outperformed the previously pub
lished results, when the baseline accuracy is more 
then 90%. There is only one published work inves
tigating the baseline accuracy much lower than 90% 
(Nagata, 1996). As we proved in the experiment, we 
outperformed his results significantly. 
7 Conclusion

We have presented a Japanese OCR error corrector. 
It arguably outperforms previously published tech
niques. To improve the error correction accuracy, 
a more sophisticated language model for unknown 
words, including numbers, acronyms, and transliter
ated foreign words, must be investigated.
