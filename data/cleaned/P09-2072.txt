Abstract
Maximum entropy (Maxent) is useful in
many areas. Iterative scaling (IS) methods
are one of the most popular approaches to
solve Maxent. With many variants of IS
methods, it is difficult to understand them
and see the differences. In this paper, we
create a general and unified framework for
IS methods. This framework also connects
IS and coordinate descent (CD) methods.
Besides, we develop a CD method for
Maxent. Results show that it is faster than
existing iterative scaling methods1.
1 Introduction
Maximum entropy (Maxent) is widely used in
many areas such as natural language processing
(NLP) and document classification. Maxent mod-
els the conditional probability as:
Pw(y|x)≡Sw(x,y)/Tw(x), (1)
Sw(x,y)≡e
P
t wtft(x,y), Tw(x)≡
summationtext
y Sw(x,y),
where x indicates a context, y is the label of the
context, and w ∈ Rn is the weight vector. A
function ft(x,y) denotes the t-th feature extracted
from the context x and the label y.
Given an empirical probability distribution
˜P(x,y) obtained from training samples, Maxent
minimizes the following negative log-likelihood:
minw −summationtextx,y ˜P(x,y)logPw(y|x)
=summationtextx ˜P(x)logTw(x)−summationtextt wt ˜P(ft), (2)
where ˜P(x) =summationtexty ˜P(x,y) is the marginal prob-
ability of x, and ˜P(ft) =summationtextx,y ˜P(x,y)ft(x,y) is
the expected value of ft(x,y). To avoid overfit-
ting the training samples, some add a regulariza-
tion term and solve:

where σ is a regularization parameter. We focus
on (3) instead of (2) because (3) is strictly convex.
Iterative scaling (IS) methods are popular in
training Maxent models. They all share the same
property of solving a one-variable sub-problem
at a time. Existing IS methods include general-
ized iterative scaling (GIS) by Darroch and Rat-
cliff (1972), improved iterative scaling (IIS) by
Della Pietra et al. (1997), and sequential condi-
tional generalized iterative scaling (SCGIS) by
Goodman (2002). In optimization, coordinate de-
scent (CD) is a popular method which also solves
a one-variable sub-problem at a time. With these
many IS and CD methods, it is uneasy to see their
differences. In Section 2, we propose a unified
framework to describe IS and CD methods from
an optimization viewpoint. Using this framework,
we design a fast CD approach for Maxent in Sec-
tion 3. In Section 4, we compare the proposed
CD method with IS and LBFGS methods. Results
show that the CD method is more efficient.
Notation n is the number of features. The total
number of nonzeros in samples and the average
number of nonzeros per feature are respectively

2 A
Framework for IS Methods
2.1 The
Framework
The one-variable sub-problem of IS methods is re-
lated to the function reduction L(w+zet)−L(w),
where et = [0,...,0,1,0,...,0]T . IS methods
differ in how they approximate the function reduc-
tion. They can also be categorized according to
whether w’s components are sequentially or par-
allely updated. In this section, we create a frame-
work in Figure 1 for these methods.
Sequential update For a sequential-update
algorithm, once a one-variable sub-problem is
solved, the corresponding element in w is up-
dated. The new w is then used to construct the
next sub-problem. The procedure is sketched in

Algorithm 1. If the t-th component is selected for
update, a sequential IS method solves the follow-
ing one-variable sub-problem:
minz At(z),
where At(z) bounds the function difference:
At(z)≥L(w + zet)−L(w)
=summationtextx ˜P(x)log Tw+zet(x)Tw(x) + Qt(z) (4)
and Qt(z)≡2wtz+z22σ2 −z ˜P(ft). (5)
An approximate function At(z) satisfying (4) does
not ensure that the function value is strictly de-
creasing. That is, the new function value L(w +
zet) may be only the same as L(w). Therefore,
we can impose an additional condition
At(0) = 0 (6)
on the approximate function At(z). If A′t(0)negationslash= 0
and assume ¯zt ≡argminz At(z) exists, with the
condition At(0)=0, we have At(¯zt)<0. This in-
equality and (4) then imply L(w + ¯ztet)<L(w).
If A′t(0) =∇tL(w) = 0, the convexity of L(w)
implies that we cannot decrease the function value
by modifying wt. Then we should move on to
modify other components of w.
A CD method can be viewed as a sequential IS
method. It solves the following sub-problem:
minz ACDt (z) = L(w + zet)−L(w)
without any approximation. Existing IS methods
consider approximations as At(z) may be simpler
for minimization.
Parallel update A parallel IS method simul-
taneously constructs n independent one-variable
sub-problems. After (approximately) solving all
of them, the whole vector w is updated. Algo-
rithm 2 gives the procedure. The differentiable
function A(z), z ∈ Rn, is an approximation of
L(w +z)−L(w) satisfying
A(z)≥L(w +z)−L(w), A(0) = 0, and
A(z) =summationtextt At(zt). (7)
Similar to (4) and (6), the first two conditions en-

sure that the function value is strictly decreasing.
The last condition shows thatA(z)is separable, so
minzA(z) =summationtextt minzt At(zt).
That is,we can minimizeAt(zt),∀t simultaneously,
and then update wt∀t together. A parallel-update
method possesses nice implementation properties.
However, since it less aggressively updates w, it
usually converges slower. If A(z) satisfies (7),
taking z = ztet implies that (4) and (6) hold for
any At(zt). A parallel method could thus be trans-
formed to a sequential method using the same ap-
proximate function, but not vice versa.
2.2 Existing
Iterative Scaling Methods
We introduce GIS, IIS and SCGIS via the pro-
posed framework. GIS and IIS use a parallel up-
date, but SCGIS is sequential. Their approximate
functions aim to bound the function reduction
L(w+z)−L(w)=summationtextx ˜P(x)logTw+z(x)Tw(x) +summationtexttQt(zt),
(8)
where Tw(x) and Qt(zt) are defined in (1) and (5),
respectively. Then GIS, IIS and SCGIS use simi-
lar inequalities to get approximate functions. They
apply logα≤α−1∀α > 0 to get

GIS defines

and adds a feature fn+1(x,y)≡f#−f#(x,y) with
zn+1 =0. Assuming ft(x,y) ≥ 0, ∀t,x,y, and

SCGIS is a sequential-update method. It replaces
f# in GIS with f#t ≡maxx,y ft(x,y). Using ztet

We prove the linear convergence of existing IS
methods (proof omitted):
Theorem 1 Assume each sub-problem Ast(zt) is
exactly minimized, where s is IIS, GIS, SCGIS, or
CD. The sequence{wk}generated by any of these
four methods linearly converges. That is, there is
a constant µ∈(0,1) such that
L(wk+1)−L(w∗)≤(1−µ)(L(wk)−L(w∗)),∀k,
where w∗ is the global optimum of (3).
2.3 Solving
one-variable sub-problems
Without the regularization term, by A′t(zt) = 0,
GIS and SCGIS both have a simple closed-form
solution of the sub-problem. With the regular-
ization term, the sub-problems no longer have a
closed-form solution. We discuss the cost of solv-
ing sub-problems by the Newton method, which
iteratively updates zt by
zt←zt−Ast′(zt)/Ast′′(zt). (11)
Here s indicates an IS or a CD method.
Below we check the calculation of Ast′(zt) as
the cost of Ast′′(zt) is similar. We have
Ast′(zt)=summationtextx,y ˜P(x)Pw(y|x)ft(x,y)eztfs(x,y)
+ Q′t(zt) (12)
where
fs(x,y)≡



f# if s is GIS,
f#t if s is SCGIS,
f#(x,y) if s is IIS.
For CD,
ACDt ′(zt)=Q′t(zt)+summationtextx,y ˜P(x)Pw+ztet(y|x)ft(x,y).
(13)
The main cost is on calculating Pw(y|x)∀x,y,
whenever w is updated. Parallel-update ap-
proaches calculate Pw(y|x) once every n sub-
problems, but sequential-update methods evalu-
ates Pw(y|x) after every sub-problem. Consider
the situation of updating w to w+ztet. By (1),
Table 1: Time for minimizing At(zt) by the New-
ton method CD GIS SCGIS IIS
1st Newton direction O(¯l) O(¯l) O(¯l) O(¯l)
Each subsequent
Newton direction O(¯l) O(1) O(1) O(¯l)
obtaining Pw+ztet(y|x) ∀x,y requires expensive
O(#nz) operations to evaluate Sw+ztet(x,y) and
Tw+ztet(x) ∀x,y. A trick to trade memory for
time is to store all Sw(x,y) and Tw(x),
Sw+ztet(x,y)=Sw(x,y)eztft(x,y),
Tw+ztet(x)=Tw(x)+summationtextySw(x,y)(eztft(x,y)−1).
Since Sw+ztet(x,y) = Sw(x,y) if ft(x,y) =
0, this procedure reduces the the O(#nz) opera-
tions to O(#nz/n) = O(¯l). However, it needs
extra spaces to store all Sw(x,y) and Tw(x).
This trick for updating Pw(y|x) has been used
in SCGIS (Goodman, 2002). Thus, the first
Newton iteration of all methods discussed here
takes O(¯l) operations. For each subsequent
Newton iteration, CD needs O(¯l) as it calcu-
lates Pw+ztet(y|x) whenever zt is changed. For
GIS and SCGIS, if summationtextx,y ˜P(x)Pw(y|x)ft(x,y)
is stored at the first Newton iteration, then (12)
can be done in O(1) time. For IIS, because
f#(x,y) of (12) depends on x and y, we cannot
store summationtextx,y ˜P(x)Pw(y|x)ft(x,y) as in GIS and
SCGIS. Hence each Newton direction needs O(¯l).
We summarize the cost for solving sub-problems
in Table 1.
3 Comparison
and a New CD Method
3.1 Comparison
of IS/CD methods
From the above discussion, an IS or a CD method
falls into a place between two extreme designs:
At(zt) a loose bound ↔At(zt) a tight bound
Easy to minimize At(zt) Hard to minimizeAt(zt)
There is a tradeoff between the tightness to bound
the function difference and the hardness to solve
the sub-problem. To check how IS and CD meth-
ods fit into this explanation, we obtain relation-
ships of their approximate functions:
ACDt (zt)≤ASCGISt (zt)≤AGISt (zt),
ACDt (zt)≤AIISt (zt)≤AGISt (zt) ∀zt. (14)
The derivation is omitted. From (14), CD con-
siders more accurate sub-problems than SCGIS
and GIS. However, to solve each sub-problem,
from Table 1, CD’s each Newton step takes more
time. The same situation occurs in comparing
IIS and GIS. Therefore, while a tight At(zt) can
287
give faster convergence by handling fewer sub-
problems, the total time may not be less due to
the higher cost of each sub-problem.
3.2 A
Fast CD Method
We develop a CD method which is cheaper in
solving each sub-problem but still enjoys fast fi-
nal convergence. This method is modified from
Chang et al. (2008), a CD approach for linear
SVM. We approximately minimize ACDt (z) by ap-
plying only one Newton iteration. The Newton di-
rection at z = 0 is now
d =−ACDt ′(0)/ACDt ′′(0). (15)
As taking the full Newton direction may not de-
crease the function value, we need a line search
procedure to find λ≥0 such that z = λd satisfies
the following sufficient decrease condition:
ACDt (z)−ACDt (0) = ACDt (z)≤γzACDt ′(0), (16)
where γ is a constant in (0,1/2). A simple
way to find λ is by sequentially checking λ =
1,β,β2,..., where β ∈ (0,1). The line search
procedure is guaranteed to stop (proof omitted).
We can further prove that near the optimum two
results hold: First, the Newton direction (15) sat-
isfies the sufficient decrease condition (16) with
λ=1. Then the cost for each sub-problem is O(¯l),
similar to that for exactly solving sub-problems of
GIS or SCGIS. This result is important as other-
wise each trial of z = λd expensively costs O(¯l)
for calculating ACDt (z). Second, taking one New-
ton direction of the tighter ACDt (zt) reduces the
function L(w) more rapidly than exactly minimiz-
ing a loose At(zt) of GIS, IIS or SCGIS. These
two results show that the new CD method im-
proves upon the traditional CD by approximately
solving sub-problems, while still maintains fast
convergence.
4 Experiments
We apply Maxent models to part of
speech (POS) tagging for BROWN corpus
(http://www.nltk.org) and chunk-
ing tasks for CoNLL2000 (http://www.
cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking).
We randomly split the BROWN corpus
to 4/5 training and 1/5 testing. Our im-
plementation is built upon OpenNLP
(http://maxent.sourceforge.net).
We implement CD (the new one in Section 3.2),
GIS, SCGIS, and LBFGS for comparisons. We
include LBFGS as Malouf (2002) reported that
it is better than other approaches including GIS

and IIS. We use σ2 = 10, and set β = 0.5 and
γ = 0.001 in (16).
We begin at checking time versus the relative
difference of the function value to the optimum:
L(w)−L(w∗)/L(w∗). (17)
Results are in the first row of Figure 2. We check
in the second row of Figure 2 about testing ac-
curacy/F1 versus training time. Among the three
IS/CD methods compared, the new CD approach
is the fastest. SCGIS comes the second, while
GIS is the last. This result is consistent with
the tightness of their approximation functions; see
(14). LBFGS has fast final convergence, but it
does not perform well in the beginning.
5 Conclusions
In summary, we create a general framework for
explaining IS methods. Based on this framework,
we develop a new CD method for Maxent. It is
more efficient than existing IS methods.
