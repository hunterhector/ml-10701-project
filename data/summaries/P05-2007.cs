Our project is currently developing grammar-like coordination formalisms that allow complex linguistic signals on multiple channels to be conveniently represented.2 3.2 ASL Computational Linguistic Models This project uses representations of discourse, semantics, syntax, and (sign) phonology tailored to ASL generation (Huenerfauth, 2004b).

We populate the volume of space around the signer’s torso with invisible 3D objects representing entities discussed by CPs being generated (Huenerfauth, 2004b).

For this reason, our English-to-ASL MT system has multiple processing pathways (Huenerfauth, 2004a).

To build the 3D placeholder model, this system uses preexisting scenevisualization software to analyze an English text describing the motion of real-world objects and build a 3D model of how the objects mentioned in text are arranged and move (Huenerfauth, 2004b).

A planning-based NLG approach, described in (Huenerfauth, 2004b), is used to select a template, fill in its missing parameters, and build a schedule of the animation events on multiple channels needed to produce a sequence of CPs.

This paper describes the design of our Englishto-ASL MT system (Huenerfauth, 2004a, 2004b, 2005), focusing on ASL generation.
