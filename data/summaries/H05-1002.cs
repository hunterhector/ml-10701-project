Applications in which IS is crucial are textto-speech systems, where IS helps to improve the quality of the speech output (Prevost and Steedman, 1994; Kruijff-Korbayov´a et al., 2003; Moore et al., 2004), and machine translation, where IS improves target word order, especially that of free word order languages (Stys and Zemke, 1995).
