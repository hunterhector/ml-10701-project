Several researchers (e.g., (Barker, 1998; Evans and Zhai, 1996; Pohlmann and Kraaij, 1997; Pustejovsky et al., 1993; Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992)) collect statistics on the occurrence frequency of structurally unambiguous two-noun compounds to inform the analysis of the ambiguous compound.

Several studies have shown that extracting modifier-head pairs from text and including these as compound indexing terms can improve recall and precision (Evans and Zhai, 1996; Pohlmann and Kraaij, 1997; Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992).

However, obtaining correct modifier-head pairs is once again hampered by “the notorious ambiguity of nominal compounds” (Strzalkowski and Vauthey, 1992, p.107).
